AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
The questions and answers below highlight only selected information set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and only briefly address
some commonly asked questions about the special meeting and the proposals to be presented at the special meeting, including with respect to the

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A: Alkuri and Babylon Holdings have agreed to a business combination under the terms of the Merger Agreement that is described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and Alkuri encourages its
stockholders to read it in its entirety. Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement,

Q: Are there any other matters being presented to stockholders at the meeting?
A: In addition to voting on the Business Combination Proposal, the stockholders of Alkuri will vote on the following proposals:

See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “Proposal Two—The Equity Plan Proposal.”

Alkuri will hold the special meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote upon these proposals. This proxy statement/prospectus contains important
information about the proposed Business Combination and the other matters to be acted upon at the special meeting. Stockholders should read it
carefully.
The vote of stockholders is important. Regardless of how many shares you own, you are encouraged to vote as soon as possible after carefully
reviewing this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q: Why is Alkuri providing stockholders with the opportunity to vote on the Business Combination?
A: Because the structure of the Transactions involves a merger of Alkuri itself, Alkuri stockholders must be afforded an opportunity to vote on the
Business Combination under Delaware law. Therefore, a stockholder meeting will be held under Delaware law to vote on the Business Combination. In
addition, pursuant to the SPAC Charter, Alkuri is required to provide stockholders with an opportunity to have their shares of Alkuri Common Stock
redeemed for cash, either through a stockholder meeting or tender offer. Due to the structure of the Transactions, Alkuri is providing this opportunity
through a stockholder vote. In addition, the Alkuri Stockholders are being asked to vote upon the Equity Plan Proposal.

any future period. The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent management’s estimates based on information available as of the date of these

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,RISK FACTORS,"Table of Contents
RISK FACTORS
If the Business Combination is completed, Babylon will operate in a market environment that is difficult to predict and that involves significant
risks, many of which will be beyond its control. You should carefully consider the risks described below before voting your shares. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to Babylon Holdings and Alkuri or that they do not currently believe are important to an investor, if they
materialize, also may adversely affect the Business Combination. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the
following risks actually occur, Babylon Holdings’ business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the
trading price of Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, Alkuri Common Stock could decline, and you may lose
part or all of the value of any Babylon Class A Shares or, if the Business Combination is not consummated, shares of Alkuri Common Stock that you
hold.
You should also consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, including the Merger Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part.
Investing in Babylon Class A Shares involves risks, some of which are related to the Business Combination. In considering the Business
Combination, you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, as well as the other information included in or incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including Babylon Holdings’ consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Babylon’s
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” The risks and uncertainties described below are those
significant risk factors, currently known and specific to us, that we believe are relevant to an investment in Babylon Class A Shares. Additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm us and adversely affect the Babylon Class A Shares.
You are also encouraged to read and consider the risk factors specific to Alkuri’s businesses (that may also affect Babylon) described in Alkuri’s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 because, as a result of the Business Combination, they will become our risks.
Please see “Where You Can Find More Information,” for information on where you can find the periodic reports and other documents we and
Alkuri have filed with or furnished to the SEC.
In this section “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Babylon Holdings prior to the Closing and Babylon following the Closing.
Risk Factors Summary
The below summary risks provide an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. The below
summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the summary risks below together with the more
detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section under the heading “Risk Factors,” as well as elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
The summary risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Babylon Holdings faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to Babylon Holdings or that it currently deems less significant may also affect Babylon Holdings’ business operations or financial results.
Consistent with the foregoing, Babylon Holdings is exposed to a variety of risks, including those associated with the following:
•
Babylon Holdings has a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and it may not be able to achieve or maintain
profitability.
•
Babylon Holdings’ relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects and increases
the risk of your investment.

Recommendation of Alkuri Board of Directors
Alkuri’s board of directors has determined that each of the proposals outlined above is fair to and in the best interests of Alkuri and its
stockholders and recommended that Alkuri Stockholders vote “FOR” the Business Combination Proposal, “FOR” the Equity Plans Proposal and “FOR”
the Adjournment Proposal, if presented.
Record Date; Persons Entitled to Vote
Alkuri Stockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if they owned shares of Alkuri Common Stock at the
close of business on September 14, 2021, which is the record date for the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote for each share of Alkuri

PROPOSAL ONE—THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL
The following is a discussion of the proposed Business Combination and the Merger Agreement. This is a summary only and may not contain all
of the information that is important to you. This summary is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Merger Agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Alkuri Stockholders are urged to read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully,
including the Merger Agreement, for a more complete understanding of the Business Combination.
General
Transaction Structure
The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Alkuri with and into Merger Sub, with Alkuri surviving the Business Combination as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Babylon.
Pro Forma Capitalization
The pro forma equity valuation of Babylon upon consummation of the Transactions is estimated to approximate $4.2 billion. We estimate that at the
Effective Time without giving effect to the issuance of Earnout Shares and assuming none of Alkuri’s public stockholders demand of their Alkuri public
shares pursuant to the SPAC Charter, the securityholders of Babylon and Babylon’s management will own more than 75% of the outstanding Babylon
Shares and the securityholders of Alkuri, the Sponsor, the Founder, and certain accredited investors purchasing PIPE Shares will own the remaining
Babylon Shares. At Closing, the Founder will own all outstanding shares of Babylon Class B Shares.
Merger Consideration
The Business Combination implies a $4.2 billion post-closing equity value and a current equity value of Babylon at $3.515 billion. Prior to the
Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon Class A Shares,
other than the Babylon

PROPOSAL TWO—THE EQUITY PLAN PROPOSAL
Overview
We are seeking shareholder approval for the Babylon Holdings Limited 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan is being
adopted by Babylon Holdings in connection with the Business Combination and will become effective upon the Closing. The 2021 Plan is intended to
replace Babylon Holding’s Prior Plans (as defined below). Shareholder approval of the 2021 Plan is being sought in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. Approval of the 2021 Plan will allow Babylon to provide equity awards as part of Babylon’s compensation program, an important tool for
motivating, attracting and retaining talented employees and for creating shareholder value. Non-approval of the 2021 Plan may compel Babylon to
significantly increase the cash component of employee compensation following the Closing to attract and retain key employees because Babylon would
need to replace components of compensation Babylon Holdings historically delivered in the form of equity awards, which could therefore reduce
Babylon’s operating cash flow.
The Alkuri board of directors believes that long-term incentive compensation programs align the interests of management, employees and
shareholders to create long-term shareholder value. Equity plans such as the 2021 Plan increase Babylon’s ability to achieve this objective, and, by
allowing for several different forms of long-term incentive awards, helps Babylon recruit, reward, motive, and retain talented personnel. The Babylon
Holdings board of directors believes that the approval of the 2021 Plan is essential to Babylon’s continued success, and in particular, Babylon’s ability to
attract and retain outstanding and highly skilled individuals in the extremely competitive labor markets in which Babylon will compete. Equity awards are
also crucial to Babylon’s ability to motivate employees to achieve its goals.
Key Plan Provisions
•
The 2021 Plan will continue until the 10th anniversary of the Closing, unless earlier terminated by the Babylon board of directors of directors
or its delegee;
•
The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of share options (including “incentive stock options” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
and options that are not incentive stock options), share appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other share based
awards;
•
45,335,210 Babylon Class A Shares will be authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2021 Plan, plus up to 23,902,282 Babylon
Class A Shares that may become available for issuance as a result of recycling of awards under Babylon Holdings’ Long Term Incentive
Plan with Non-Employee Sub-Plan and Babylon Holdings’ Company Share Option plan (the “Prior Plans”);
•
The 2021 Plan provides for an automatic share reserve increase feature, whereby the share reserve will automatically be increased on the
first day of each fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to the least of
(i) 5% of the total number of Class A Shares outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, (ii) 45,335,210 Babylon Class A
Shares or (iii) such number of Babylon Class A Shares as the board of directors may designate prior to the applicable January 1. The

PROPOSAL THREE—THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
The Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow Alkuri’s board of directors to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary. In
no event will Alkuri solicit proxies to adjourn the special meeting or consummate the Transactions beyond the date by which it may properly do so under
the SPAC Charter and Delaware law. The purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to provide more time to meet the requirements that are necessary to
consummate the Transactions. See the section titled “Proposal One – The Business Combination Proposal —Interests of Certain Persons in the
Business Combination.”
Consequences If the Adjournment Proposal Is Not Approved
If the Adjournment Proposal is presented to the meeting and is not approved by the stockholders, Alkuri’s board of directors may not be able to
adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates if necessary to provide additional time to allow the parties to consummate the Transactions. In such
event, the Transactions may not be completed.
Required Vote
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Alkuri Common Stock
present and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, abstentions of votes in attendance at the meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“against” the Adjournment Proposal. Brokers are entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal absent voting instructions from the beneficial holder
because the proposal is considered “routine.” Consequently, there should be no broker non-votes with respect to the Adjournment Proposal.
Recommendation
THE ALKURI BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL
OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
For a discussion of the Business Combination structure and merger consideration provisions of the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled
“Proposal One – The Merger Agreement Proposal.” Such discussion and the following summary of other material provisions of the Merger Agreement
is qualified by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. All
Alkuri Stockholders are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the
Business Combination.
The Merger Agreement summary below is included in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not to provide any other factual information regarding Alkuri, Babylon or their respective businesses.
Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read
only in conjunction with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Terms of the Merger; Reclassification; Merger Consideration
Prior to the Closing, Babylon will effect the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of Babylon Holdings will be reclassified into Babylon
Class A Shares, other than the Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, which will be reclassified as Babylon Class B Shares. As a result of the Reclassification,
each outstanding Babylon Class A Share and Babylon Class B Share will have a value at the time of the Business Combination of $10.00 (based on the
$3.515 billion equity value of Babylon Holdings). At the Closing, the Babylon Class B Shares will be held by the Founder. The Babylon Class B Shares
will have the same economic terms as the Babylon Class A Shares, but the Babylon Class B Shares will have 15 votes per share (while each Babylon Class
A Share will have one vote per share).
At the Closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into Alkuri, with Alkuri continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Babylon. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Alkuri Common Stock (excluding shares held in treasury by Alkuri) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive one (1) Babylon Class A Share.
It is anticipated that, upon completion of the Business Combination: (i) Alkuri’s public stockholders will own approximately 7.8% of the Babylon
Shares and 2.2% of the voting power of Babylon; (ii) the PIPE Investors will own approximately 5.2% of the Babylon Shares and 1.5% of the voting power
of Babylon; (iii) the Sponsor and current Alkuri directors will own approximately 2.0% of the Babylon Shares (including the Sponsor Earnout Shares) and
0.6% of the voting power of Babylon; and (iv) the existing Babylon Holdings shareholders will own approximately 85.0% of the Babylon Shares and
95.8% of the voting power of Babylon with 81.7% of the voting power (taking account of the Stockholder Earnout Shares) of Babylon being held by the
Founder. These levels of ownership interest: (a) exclude the impact of the warrants to purchase Babylon Shares that will remain outstanding immediately
following the Business Combination; (b) assume that no Alkuri public stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to its shares for a pro rata
portion of the funds in Alkuri’s trust account and (c) exclude the potential impact of the Higi acquisition. The foregoing also excludes shares being
purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE Investment. When including the shares purchased by the Sponsor and its affiliates in the PIPE
Investment, the Sponsor and its affiliates will own approximately 2.2% of the Babylon Shares and 0.6% of the voting power of Babylon assuming no
redemptions and approximately 2.4% of the Babylon Shares and 0.7% of the voting power of Babylon assuming maximum redemptions.
Closing and Effective Time of the Transactions
The Closing of the Transactions will take place as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than the third business day following
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the “Closing Date”) and summarized below under the subsection entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing of the Transactions,” unless Alkuri and Babylon agree in writing to another time or unless the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms. The Transactions are expected to be consummated promptly after the special meeting of Alkuri
Stockholders described in this proxy statement/prospectus.

AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The following discussion summarizes material provisions of certain Ancillary Agreements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement.
Complete copies of the form of the Ancillary Agreements described below are set forth in the exhibits to the registration statement to which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, and are incorporated by reference.
Subscription Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Alkuri and Babylon Holdings entered into certain Subscription Agreements with the
PIPE Investors, whereby each PIPE Investor subscribed for, and Babylon Holdings agreed to sell and issue to such PIPE Investor, a number of Babylon
Class A Shares at and in connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, in an amount not exceed 23,000,000 Babylon Class A Shares in the
aggregate.
Entities affiliated with the Sponsor have agreed to purchase 1,300,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on
substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. Entities affiliated with Dr. Ali Parsadoust have agreed to purchase 200,000
Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors. (i) Per Brilioth,
member of Babylon Holdings’ board of directors, and VNV (Cyprus) Limited, a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, and (ii)
Georgi Ganev, member of Babylon’s board of directors, and Invik S.A., a holder of greater than 5% of Babylon Holdings’ share capital, have each agreed
to purchase 500,000 Babylon Class A Shares pursuant to Subscription Agreements on substantially the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE
Investors.
As of the date hereof, issuance or sale of the Babylon Class A Shares in connection with the Subscription Agreement has not been registered
under the Securities Act. Babylon has agreed, within 15 calendar days of Closing to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of
such Babylon Class A Shares and will use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing
thereof, but in any event no later than the earlier of (1) sixty (60) calendar days (or ninety (90) calendar days if the SEC notifies Babylon that it will
“review” the registration statement) following the Closing and (ii) the tenth (10th) business day after the date of Babylon is notified (in writing) by the
SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will be subject to further review.
Voting and Support Agreements
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Babylon Holdings and Alkuri entered into the Voting and Support Agreement with
certain Babylon Holdings’ shareholders, whereby each such Babylon Holdings’ shareholder agreed to (i) not revoke their written consents approving the
Business Combination as shareholders of Babylon Holdings’, and (ii) vote (or cause to be voted) all of such Babylon Holdings’ shareholder’s Covered
Shares (as defined in the Voting and Support Agreement): (A) in favor of any other matters necessary for consummation of the Transactions, (B) against
authorizing the company to take action set forth in Section 5.01(a) of the Merger Agreement, and (C) against any Alternative Transaction or Proposed
Alternative Transaction (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), or any other action that would reasonably be expected to materially impede
the Transactions. These obligations of such Babylon Holdings’ shareholders apply regardless of any recommendation by Babylon’s board of directors.
The Voting and Support Agreement also contains other negative covenants, pursuant to which each Babylon Holdings’ shareholders party to the
agreement promises not to (i) enter into any agreement of voting trust or grant a proxy or power of attorney with respect to any of such Babylon
Holdings’ shareholder’s Covered Shares that is inconsistent with such shareholder’s obligations under the Voting and Support Agreement, (ii) enter into
any agreement or undertaking that is otherwise inconsistent with, interfere with, or prohibit the Babylon Holdings’ shareholder from satisfying its
obligation under the Voting and Support Agreement, or (iii) solicit, negotiate, approve, resolve or endorse or take certain other actions with respect to any
Alternative Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined
below, and together, “Holders”) of Alkuri Common Stock and warrants exercisable for shares of Alkuri Class A Common Stock (“Alkuri Warrants” and,
together with Alkuri Common Stock, each, an “Alkuri Security”) (other than the Sponsor or any of its affiliates) of (i) electing to have their Alkuri
Common Stock redeemed for cash if the Business Combination is completed, (ii) the Business Combination, and/or (iii) the ownership and disposition of
Babylon Class A Shares and warrants exercisable for Babylon Class A Shares (the ”Babylon Warrants”) after the Business Combination. This section
applies only to Holders that hold their Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares, and Babylon Warrants, as the case may be, as “capital assets” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, because the components of an Alkuri unit are
generally separable at the option of the Holder, the Holder of an Alkuri unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the
owner of the underlying Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrant components of the Alkuri unit. Accordingly, the separation of an Alkuri unit into the
one share of Alkuri Common Stock and the one-fourth of one Alkuri Warrant underlying the Alkuri unit generally should not be a taxable event for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a contrary position. Holders of Alkuri Securities are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and any non-U.S.
tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination (including any redemption of Alkuri Common Stock) with respect to
any Alkuri Common Stock and Alkuri Warrants held through Alkuri units (including alternative characterizations of Alkuri units). This discussion
generally assumes that the characterization of Alkuri units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is included for general informational purposes only, does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
might be relevant to a Holder, and does not constitute, and is not, a tax opinion for or tax advice to any particular Holder. This discussion is limited to U.S.
federal income tax considerations and does not address estate or any gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address any tax consequences to investors that directly or indirectly hold equity
interests in Babylon prior to the Business Combination. With respect to consequences of holding Babylon Class A Shares, this discussion is limited to
holders who acquire such Babylon Class A Shares in connection with the Business Combination or as a result of the exercise of a Babylon Warrant, and
with respect to Babylon Warrants, this discussion is limited to holders who hold such Babylon Warrants as a result of their ownership of Alkuri Warrants
prior to and through the Business Combination. This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain investment income and the different
consequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law that apply to certain types of investors, such as:
•
financial institutions or financial services entities;
•
broker-dealers;
•
taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules with respect to the Alkuri Securities, Babylon Class A Shares and/or
Babylon Warrants, as the case may be;

MATERIAL JERSEY TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following summary of the anticipated treatment of Babylon and holders of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants (other than residents of
Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at the date of this document and is subject to changes in such
taxation law and practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice (including such tax law
and practice as they apply to any land or building situate in Jersey). Prospective investors in Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants should consult
their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.
Taxation of Babylon
Babylon is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, Babylon will not be liable to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey
source income (except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and dividends on
Babylon ordinary shares may be paid by Babylon without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of Babylon
ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other
disposition of such Babylon ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants.
Stamp duty / transfer taxes
In Jersey, no stamp duty or other transfer tax is levied on the issue or transfer of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants except that stamp duty
is payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants
on the death of a holder of such Babylon ordinary shares and/or Babylon warrants. In the case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp
duty is levied according to the size of the estate (wherever situated in respect of a holder of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants domiciled in Jersey,
or situated in Jersey in respect of a holder of Babylon Shares and/or Babylon Warrants domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a
rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000.
Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate duties.
IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO YOUR TAX POSITION YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVISER.

ALKURI’S BUSINESS
Introduction
Alkuri was incorporated on December 1, 2020 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Alkuri’s efforts to identify a prospective
target business were not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although it initially focused its search for target businesses on
companies operating in the technology industry. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, Alkuri’s efforts were limited to organizational activities,
completion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.
Initial Public Offering and Simultaneous Private Placement
On February 9, 2021, Alkuri closed the Alkuri IPO of 34,500,000 Alkuri units (after taking into account the full exercise of the over-allotment option
by Alkuri’s underwriters), with each unit consisting of one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock and one-fourth of one redeemable Alkuri Warrant, with
each whole Alkuri Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing 30 days
after the consummation of an initial business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business
The target business that Alkuri acquires must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust
account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive
agreement for its initial business combination, although Alkuri may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the
trust account balance. Alkuri’s board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Babylon
Holdings as described in the section entitled “Proposal One—The Business Combination Proposal—Satisfaction of 80% Test” above.
Stockholder Approval of Business Combination
Under the SPAC Charter, Alkuri must seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which
public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri public shares converted into cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed
business combination or do not vote at all, subject to the limitations described in the prospectus for the Alkuri IPO. Accordingly, in connection with the
Business Combination, the Alkuri public stockholders may seek to have their Alkuri Common Stock converted to cash in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Special Meeting of Alkuri Stockholders—Conversion Rights.”
Voting in Connection with the Stockholder Meeting
In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, including the vote with respect to the Business Combination Proposal, Alkuri
Stockholders prior to the Alkuri IPO and its officers and directors have each agreed to vote their Alkuri Common Stock in favor of such proposed
Business Combination.
At any time prior to the special meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material nonpublic information regarding Alkuri or its
securities, the Alkuri initial stockholders, its officers and directors, Babylon shareholders and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares from
institutional and other investors who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination Proposal, or execute agreements to
purchase such shares from them in the future, or they may enter into transactions with such persons and others to provide them with incentives to
acquire Alkuri Common Stock or vote their shares in favor of the Business

BABYLON’S BUSINESS
In this section, all references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the business of Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the
Business Combination, and may also include the professional corporations and limited liability companies that have an exclusive management
services arrangement with a Babylon Holdings entity, and that deliver professional healthcare services to members via its network of employed or
contract providers.
Overview
We are a leading digital-first, value-based care company. Founded in 2013, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable
for everyone on Earth. We believe we are poised to reengineer the global healthcare market to better align system-wide incentives and to shift the focus
from reactive sick care to preventative healthcare, resulting in better member health, improved member experience and reduced costs. To achieve this goal,
we are leveraging our highly scalable, digital-first platform combined with high quality clinical operations and affiliated provider networks to provide an
integrated, end-to-end healthcare solution.
We believe the growing $10 trillion global healthcare market, which is expected to continue to grow over the coming decades, has been unable to
balance the need for accessibility, quality and affordability. These challenges, facing healthcare systems in both developed and developing markets, have
not been properly addressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which is often country or even region specific. While this is generally
referred to as “health care”, we consider it “sick care,” as we believe the traditional fee-for-service (“FFS”) model is designed to focus on treating patients
when they are sick rather than helping them stay healthy. In an effort to address resource scarcity, new healthcare technologies have begun to emerge;
however, we believe that existing digital tools, including telemedicine, are simply shifting the site of care but don’t address the fundamental issues of
when and how care is provided. The frustrations and limitations of “sick care” are spurring a movement towards value-based care (“VBC”), which ties
financial performance to medical outcomes. However, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given the upfront human capital and physical
infrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.
We believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain by delivering a digital-first, integrated, end-to-end healthcare solution. Our core
solution, Babylon 360, couples our digital platform with a VBC approach, where we assume responsibility for the medical costs for a group of members in
exchange for a fixed fee per member, aligning incentives to encourage better healthcare decision making while maintaining high clinical quality and
excellent member experience. Our digital-first approach enables our members to access the full spectrum of care services, from preventative care, to
consultation, to treatment, to rehabilitation and post-care, through our end-to-end digital platform. We believe that our integrated digital platform allows
us to gather data and insights to continually improve our member experience and their care management. We work with our affiliated providers to take a
proactive approach to members’ health by actively engaging with members through our digital platform, clinical operations and provider networks to (i)
provide actionable insights and information about their wellbeing so that they can set their health goals, (ii) help our members to monitor their health on
an ongoing basis, (iii) intervene early to provide the right care, medication and treatment, including by connecting patients with effective medical advice,
including affiliated licensed physicians available 24/7, (iv) design a clear clinical care plan as needed for recovery and rehabilitation, and (v) transition
rehabilitated patients from sick care to well care. For the approximately one-in-ten members that need in-person care, we leverage our existing network of
affiliated medical professionals in conjunction with existing health plan provider networks and contracted physician networks to provide in-person care,
reducing the need for our investment in resource- and capital- intensive infrastructure. In practice, this structure allows us to reduce the need for costly
member interactions with medical professionals, help prevent unnecessary acute or urgent care visits, and proactively manage chronic conditions.
With Babylon 360, our digital-first VBC solution, we partner with insurance companies, enterprises, governments, and provider networks to deliver
our holistic care solution for a population of identified members.

those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those described under “Risk Factors” and
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified the following critical accounting policies. For a more detailed discussion of Alkuri’s Accounting Policies, please see Note 2 to
the financial statements of Alkuri included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Warrant Liability
Alkuri accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms
and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants
are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the
requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to Alkuri’s own ordinary shares, among other
conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and
as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of
additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are
required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a Modified Black
Scholes approach which includes a Monte Carlo simulation.
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
Alkuri accounts for its Alkuri Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480
“Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at
fair value. Conditionally convertible Alkuri Common Stock (including Alkuri Common Stock that features redemption rights that are either within the
control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within Alkuri’s control) is classified as temporary
equity. At all other times, Alkuri Common Stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Alkuri Common Stock features certain redemption rights that are
considered by Alkuri to be outside of Alkuri’s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Alkuri Common Stock outstanding during the
period, excluding shares of Alkuri Common Stock subject to forfeiture. Alkuri has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Alkuri IPO and
private placement to purchase an aggregate of 14,558,333 shares in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants are
contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.

BABYLON’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements,” “Selected
Historical Financial Information of Babylon Holdings” and Babylon Holdings Limited’s audited consolidated financial statements, including the
notes thereto, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Discussion is based on Babylon Holdings Limited’s financial information
prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, which may differ in material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in other
jurisdictions, including U.S. GAAP. Certain statements in this “Babylon’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under sections
titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” “We,” “us,” and “our” as used herein refer to Babylon
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and to Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries
(including Alkuri) following the consummation of the Business Combination.
Overview
Babylon Holdings is a leading, global, end-to-end healthcare solution provider utilizing advanced digital-first pathways to deliver meaningfully-
improved healthcare to our customers. Babylon Holdings develops affordable healthcare services accessible to members on digital devices platforms and
providing technology solutions to medical professionals by automating routine tasks for the care of patients. It also uses its technology to step in early
and help members become more informed about medical events, so they can make informed decisions and stay healthier longer. Babylon Holdings
combines artificial intelligence and broader technologies with human expertise to deliver modern healthcare.
We monetize our products and services in three primary ways:
•
Value-Based Care, or VBC, in which we manage a proportion or the entire medical costs of a member population and capture the cost savings.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 32.9% and 51.6%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from
value based care arrangements.
•
Clinical Services, in which our affiliated providers deliver medical consultations, typically on a fee-for-service basis. During the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 36.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from clinical services.
•
Software Licensing, in which we sell our digital suite of products to partners who provide care through their own medical networks. During the year
ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, 31.0% and 34.3%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from software
licensing.
As of July 31, 2021, approximately 24 million members had access to our VBC, clinical and/or software offerings in 16 countries across Europe,
North America, Asia, and Africa. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United
States, with over 100,000 VBC members as of July 31, 2021, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Our company has developed as follows:
•
2013: Founded by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ali Parsadoust.
•
2014: Became the first digital-first health service provider to be registered with the CQC, the healthcare services regulator and inspector in England.
•
2015: Began providing clinical services through our virtual care platform, offering diagnosis, advice and treatments via medical professionals to
patients on a remote basis.
•
2016: First expanded outside the United Kingdom, launching in Rwanda.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Alkuri
Sponsor Shares
In December 2020, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. The number of shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock issued to the Sponsor was determined based on the
expectation that such shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of Alkuri Common Stock upon completion
of the Alkuri IPO. The shares of Alkuri Class B Common Stock (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not,
subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.
Alkuri Private Placement Warrants
The Sponsor purchased 5,933,333 private placement warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrants in a private placement that occurred
simultaneously with the closing of the Alkuri IPO. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Alkuri Class A
Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Alkuri Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
thereof) may not, subject to certain limitation, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.
Agreements with Directors and Officers and their Affiliates
No compensation of any kind, including any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid
by us to the Sponsor, Alkuri’s officers and directors, or any affiliate of the Sponsor or Alkuri’s officers, prior to, or in connection with any services
rendered in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these
individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on Alkuri’s behalf, such as identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Alkuri does not have a policy that prohibits the Sponsor, executive
officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Alkuri’s
audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors, or any of their affiliates and will
determinate which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on Alkuri’s behalf.
Affiliate Loans
The Sponsor agreed to loan Alkuri up to an aggregate of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the Alkuri IPO. Alkuri had borrowed
$300,000 under such promissory note and repaid $300,000 upon the closing of the Alkuri IPO out of the offering proceeds that had been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the
Sponsor or certain of Alkuri’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan Alkuri funds as may be required. If Alkuri complete an initial
business combination, Alkuri would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, Alkuri may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from Alkuri’s trust account would be used
for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants discussed above, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The
terms of such loans by Alkuri’s officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist

A summary of the material provisions governing Babylon’s share capital immediately following the completion of the Business Combination is
provided below. This summary is not complete and should be read together with the Babylon Articles, a copy of which is appended to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Babylon.
The following is a description of the material terms of the Babylon Articles that will be in effect upon the Closing of the Business Combination. The
following descriptions of share capital and provisions of the Babylon Articles are summaries and are qualified by reference to the Babylon Articles, a
copy of which is appended to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. The description of the ordinary shares reflects changes to our capital structure that will occur upon the closing
of the Transactions.
Share Capital
Upon the Closing of the Business Combination, Babylon’s authorized share capital will be $409,896.05 divided into 6,500,000,000 Class A ordinary
shares with a par or nominal value of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the “Babylon Class A Shares”), 3,100,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par
value of $0.0000422573245084686 each (the “Babylon Class B Shares”), and 100,000,000 deferred shares with a par value of $0.0000422573245084686 each.
Following the Closing, there will be 361,714,531 Babylon Class A Shares, 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares and no deferred shares outstanding. Each
issued Babylon Share is fully paid.
Conversion of Babylon Class B Shares
The Babylon Articles contain both mandatory and optional mechanics whereby Babylon Class B Shares may be converted into Babylon Class A
Shares.
From a mandatory perspective, Babylon Class B Shares will automatically convert and immediately be treated as Babylon Class A Shares in the
following circumstances:
•
with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds by nominal value of the issued Babylon Class B Shares;
•
upon any transfer of the Babylon Class B Shares to any person (other than to specified permitted transferees of Ali Parsadoust);
•
where any of the Babylon Class B Shares cease to be beneficially owned at any time by Dr. Ali Parsadoust or any of his permitted
transferees;
•
on such date that (i) Dr. Parsadoust (together with any of his permitted transferees) no longer hold at least five per cent of the Babylon
Class B Shares held by Dr. Parsadoust (together with his permitted transferees) at the Closing of the Business Combination and (ii) is either
(a) at least 12 months following Dr. Parsadoust’s voluntary resignation as CEO and director of Babylon or (b) at least 12 months following
the death or permanent incapacity of Dr. Parsadoust.
The Babylon Articles also contain a series of optional conversion mechanics for the Babylon Class B Shares, primarily that a holder of Babylon
Class B Shares is entitled at any time to convert all (or part) of their holding of fully-paid Babylon Class B Shares to the same number of fully paid
Babylon Class A Shares by delivering to the company (or its representative) written notice of such conversion (and in the case of a certificated share, the

DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON WARRANTS
Public Warrants
Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Babylon Class A Share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time
commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the Alkuri IPO or 30 days after the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of ordinary shares. This means that
only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued and only whole warrants will trade. The
warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the date that is five years after the date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
Babylon will not be obligated to deliver any ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant
exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Babylon Class A Shares underlying the Babylon Warrants is then
effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to Babylon satisfying its registration obligations. No warrant will be exercisable and
Babylon will not be obligated to issue ordinary shares upon exercise of a warrant unless ordinary shares issuable upon such warrant exercise have been
registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that
the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to
exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will Babylon be required to net cash settle any warrant.
If a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day
following the closing of the Business Combination or during any period when Babylon has failed to maintain an effective registration statement, warrant
holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not
be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.
Babylon may call the warrants for redemption:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $0.01 per warrant when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00;
•
at a price of $0.10 per warrant when the price per ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00;
•
upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder;
•
if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares of Babylon equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits,
stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing on the
date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and ending three business days before Babylon
sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if, and only if, the closing price of the ordinary shares of Babylon equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the
number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant and the like) for any 20 trading days within the 30-day period
ending three trading days before Babylon sends notice of the redemption to the warrant holders.
If and when the warrants become redeemable by Babylon, Babylon may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of ordinary shares upon
exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Babylon is unable to effect such
registration or qualification.

ALKURI GLOBAL ACQUISITION CORP._20210930_DEFM14A_19561988_4303635.Pdf,COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF BABYLON SHAREHOLDERS AND ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS,"Table of Contents
COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF BABYLON SHAREHOLDERS
AND ALKURI STOCKHOLDERS
The rights of the shareholders of Babylon and the relative powers of the Babylon board of directors are governed by the laws of the Bailiwick of
Jersey and the Babylon Articles. As a result of the Transactions, securities held by the Alkuri Stockholders will be canceled and automatically converted
into the right to receive Babylon Class A Shares and/or Babylon Warrants. Each Babylon Share will be issued in accordance with, and subject to the
rights and obligations of, the Babylon Articles which will be effective upon the consummation of the Transactions, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Annex B. Because Babylon will be, at the Effective Time, a company organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, the rights of the
stockholders of Alkuri will be governed by Jersey law and the Babylon Articles.
Many of the principal attributes of Babylon Shares and Alkuri Common Stock will be similar. However, there are differences between the rights of
shareholders of Babylon under Jersey law and the rights of stockholders of Alkuri, as in effect prior to the consummation of the Transactions under the
DGCL. In addition, there are differences between the Babylon Articles as such will be in effect from and after the consummation of the Transactions and
the SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri.
The following is a summary comparison of the material differences between the rights of Alkuri securityholders under the SPAC Charter, Alkuri
bylaws and the DGCL, and the rights of Babylon shareholders under Jersey law and the Babylon Articles to be effective upon consummation of the
Transactions. The discussion in this section does not include a description of rights or obligations under the United States federal securities laws or the
NYSE listing requirements or of Babylon’s or Alkuri’s governance or other policies.
The statements in this section are a summary of the material rights of shareholders under the Jersey Companies Law, the Babylon Articles, the
DGCL and the SPAC Charter and bylaws of Alkuri as they will be in effect from and after the Effective Time. The SPAC Charter is filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. You are also urged to carefully read the Jersey Companies Law and the
DGCL.

Babylon
Authorized and Outstanding Share Capital
The authorized capital stock of Alkuri is
400,000,000 shares of Alkuri Common Stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of which 380,000,000
shares are designated as Alkuri Class A Common
Stock and 20,000,000 shares are designated as
Alkuri Class B Common Stock, and 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per
share. Pursuant to the SPAC Charter, prior to the
Closing, the shares of Alkuri Class B Common
Stock will automatically convert into shares of
Alkuri Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one
basis.
Upon the Closing, Babylon’s authorized
share capital will consist of $409,896.05
divided into 6,500,000,000 Babylon Class A
Shares with a par value of
$0.0000422573245084686 each, 3,100,000,000

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES
Beneficial Ownership of Babylon Shares Following the Business Combination
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of Babylon Class A Shares and Babylon Class B Shares immediately
before the Closing after effecting the Reclassification and immediately following the Closing by:
•
each person who is expected by Babylon to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the outstanding Babylon Class A Shares immediately
following the consummation of the Business Combination;
•
each person who is expected to become an executive officer or a director of Babylon upon consummation of the Business Combination; and
•
all of the executive officers and directors of Babylon as a group upon consummation of the Business Combination.
Beneficial ownership for the purposes of the following table is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. A person is a
“beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of the security, or
“investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of the security or has the right to acquire such powers within 60
days. Unless otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, Babylon believes that all persons named in the table have sole
voting and investment power with respect to all Babylon Class A Shares beneficially owned by them.
The pre-Business Combination beneficial ownership assumes that Babylon effects the Reclassification whereby each outstanding share of
Babylon Holdings is reclassified into Babylon Class A Shares, other than the Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, which are reclassified as Babylon Class
B Shares, and is based on 295,589,531 Babylon Holdings Class A Shares, 40,837,576 Babylon Holdings Class B Shares, in each case as of August 31,
2021.
The expected beneficial ownership of shares of Babylon Shares post-Business Combination assumes two scenarios:
•
SCENARIO A – in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, a “no redemption” scenario where (a) no shares of Alkuri
Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and (b) Babylon Holdings issues shares of
Babylon Class A Shares as the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including the Stockholder Earnout Shares, the
Alkuri Public Shares and the Sponsor Shares; and
•
SCENARIO B – in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, a “redemption” scenario where, after giving effect to each of
the events in Scenario A, all 34,500,000 Alkuri Public Shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination.
Based on the foregoing assumptions, and including the 23,000,000 shares of Babylon Class A Shares to be issued in connection with the PIPE
Investment, we estimate that there would be 361,714,531 shares of Babylon Class A Shares and 79,637,576 shares of Babylon Class B Shares issued and
outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination in the “no redemption” scenario, and 327,214,531 shares of Babylon
Class A Shares and 79,637,576 Babylon Class B Shares issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination in
the “redemption” scenario. If the actual facts are different from the foregoing assumptions, ownership figures in Babylon and the columns under Post-
Business Combination in the table that follows will be different. In either Scenario A or Scenario B, each shareholder of Babylon that will control 10% or
more of the voting power in Babylon following the consummation of the Business Combination was also a shareholder of Babylon Holdings that
controlled 10% or more of the voting power in Babylon Holdings prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. The following table does

The consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, have been included in this proxy statement/prospectus in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP (United
Kingdom) (“KPMG”), independent registered public accounting firm, appearing elsewhere herein and upon the authority of said firm as experts in
accounting and auditing.
KPMG audited the consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings Limited for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and were in
compliance with the independence requirements of the United Kingdom (the Financial Reporting Council’s (“FRC”) Ethical Standard and the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics (“IESBA”)) for such periods and when the respective audit reports included in this proxy
statement/prospectus were issued. In addition, for 2020, KPMG was required to be independent under SEC and PCAOB independence Rules and
Regulations. However, during 2020, one of KPMG’s affiliates, referred to as a KPMG member firm, provided non-audit services pursuant to an
engagement between an upstream controlling affiliate of Babylon Holdings and that KPMG member firm. This related to the delivery of a service that
consisted of a legal service and a management function, to an upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings that was impermissible when evaluated under the
auditor independence standards of Regulation S-X and of the PCAOB. The KPMG member firm that engaged in delivery of this service did not include
KPMG U.K. or any of its staff and did not provide any audit services to Babylon Holdings. Under local and IESBA rules this service was permissible.
This impermissible non-audit service was related to a legal service and a management function on the structure of a property investment by an
upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings and did not relate to the core group business activities that will be included in Babylon Holdings’ consolidated
financial statements. None of the deliverables under the service will be subject to audit procedures performed by KPMG U.K. as part of Babylon
Holdings’ audit, and the service had no impact on the internal control over financial reporting of Babylon Holdings. Together, the KPMG member firm
earned fees of approximately 17,000 Euro ($19,000 USD equivalent) in 2020 in relation to this non-audit service. These fees were insignificant to the
business of the relevant KPMG member firm providing the service as well as to Babylon. The management of the upstream affiliate of Babylon Holdings
Limited retained all decision making and ultimate responsibility for the service provided, and the service was completed and exited in September 2020.
The audit committee of the Babylon Holdings board of directors and KPMG have separately considered the impact that this impermissible non-
audit service may have had on KPMG’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to their audits of Babylon Holdings. Both the audit committee of the
Babylon Holdings board of directors and KPMG have concluded this non-audit service did not affect KPMG’s ability to exercise objective and impartial
judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement performed by KPMG for the consolidated financial statements of Babylon Holdings for
the year ended December 31, 2020, and that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same
conclusion.
The financial statements of Alkuri Global Acquisition Corp. as of December 31, 2020 and for the period from December 1, 2020 (inception) through
December 31, 2020 appearing in this proxy statement/prospectus have been audited by Marcum LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
set forth in their report thereon, appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and are included in reliance on the report of such firm given

ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITY
Babylon is a company organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off
the coast of Normandy, France. Accordingly, you may have difficulty serving legal process within the United States upon Babylon. You may also have
difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against Babylon in any action, including actions
based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Furthermore, there is doubt that Jersey courts would enter judgments in
original actions brought in those courts predicated on U.S. federal or state securities laws. However, Babylon may be served with process in the United
States with respect to actions against Babylon arising out of or in connection with violation of U.S. federal securities laws relating to offers and sales of
Babylon’s securities by serving Babylon’s U.S. agent irrevocably appointed for that purpose.
