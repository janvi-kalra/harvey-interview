"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",The Special Meeting,1,10,None,""" (page 23)
Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of Company stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023,
at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock of Duck Creek, par value
$0.01 per share (“Duck Creek Common Stock”), including unvested Company RSAs (as defined below), at the close
of business on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote
at the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the
Record Date.
Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals
to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger (collectively, the
“Special Meeting Proposals”).
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to
be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and
4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. The presence of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As a result, 68,453,220 shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders present and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting to have a quorum. Shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are counted as present if:
•
such shares are present in person at the virtual Special Meeting; or
•
a proxy card has been properly submitted by mail, by telephone or over the Internet with respect to such
shares.
If you submit your proxy card, regardless of whether you abstain from voting on one or more of the Special
Meeting Proposals, your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be counted as present at the Special Meeting for
the purpose of determining a quorum. If your shares are held in “street name,” your shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum if your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
 
1
TABLE OF CONTENTS
submits a proxy covering your shares. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any instruction to
your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting, those shares
will not be entitled to vote on any Special Meeting Proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining a
quorum.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, provided
a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not
anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the
purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have
no effect on a particular proposal.
Share Ownership of Duck Creek’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote
all of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
How You Can Vote
You may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
1.
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
2.
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
3.
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
4.
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. To vote during the Special
Meeting, you must do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using
the 16-digit control number included in your proxy materials.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name, you are considered the
stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other
nominee, then the broker, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to
those shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said
to be held in “street name.” Street name holders generally cannot submit a proxy or vote their shares directly and
must instead instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares using the methods described
above. Because the proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee does not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a
voting instruction form with the Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the
other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were
given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the
instructions provided on the enclosed voting instruction form to provide your instructions over the Internet, by
telephone or by signing, dating and returning the voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Please submit your
proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not have
access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and returning the
enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you
properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you
have directed.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the
Internet, by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or
superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no
direction is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy
card according to the recommendation of Duck Creek’s board of directors (the “Board”) “FOR” both of the Special
Meeting Proposals."""

for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01393 (referred to as the “O’Dell Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Karthik Reddiar v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01449 (referred to as the “Reddiar Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Tim Dangerfield v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01483 (referred to as the “Dangerfield Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
On February 23, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned Kimberly Powell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-
cv-01526 (referred to as the “Powell Complaint” and together with the O’Dell Complaint, the Reddiar Complaint and
the Dangerfield Complaint, the “Complaints”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger
(referred to as the “Preliminary Proxy Statement”) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and
information concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and
Evercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into
between Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek
and potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the
Complaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain
allegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the
terms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not
contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the
defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring
that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

Company is subject to customary “no-shop” restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative Acquisition Proposals
from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third
parties regarding any alternative Acquisition Proposals, subject to a customary “fiduciary out” provision that allows
the Company, under certain specified circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and
engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the Special Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such alternative Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law."""

Special Committee, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (1) there has been an Intervening Event;
or (2) the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Board may
only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (i) for an Intervening Event or (ii) in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if, in each case, the Special Committee determines in good faith (after

fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and subject to additional requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including, in certain circumstances, payment of the Company Termination Fee.

If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Company stockholders and beneficial owners who
continuously hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial owners may
be entitled to have their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”), and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of
Chancery, as described further below. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Company stockholders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock must: (1)
deliver a written demand for appraisal to Duck Creek before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (3)
continue to hold or beneficially own, as applicable, their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective
Time; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Duck Creek Common Stock unless certain stock
ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders and beneficial owners seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the
relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the
applicable statutory provisions are accessible, without subscription or cost, at the

rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth
above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is
made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of

The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the
Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Company stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we
refer to in this Proxy Statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 112 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On January 8, 2023, Duck Creek entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Duck Creek, with Duck Creek surviving the Merger as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the
Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board is furnishing this Proxy
Statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in connection with the solicitation
of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposal to be
voted on at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes
information that we are required to provide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting
on the matters presented at the Special Meeting. Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date may
attend the Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Duck Creek?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Duck Creek by Parent through the Merger of Merger Sub with and
into Duck Creek pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved
by the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck
Creek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek
expects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Duck Creek would no longer
be a publicly traded company, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of
Duck Creek Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $19.00 in
cash, without interest, for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For
example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, you will be entitled to receive
$1,900.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the
Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023, are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals
 
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to
vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are
described under the question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Company stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
•
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special
Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting
instruction form with this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to
the other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to
which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to
authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to
vote shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend
the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be
counted.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs, is entitled to cast one vote on
each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock, including
each unvested Company RSA, that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual meeting format only on the virtual meeting website. You will
not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. Once admitted to the Special Meeting,
stockholders may vote their shares and view a list of stockholders by following the instructions available on the
meeting website. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must do so by logging into
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control number included in your
proxy materials.
We recommend that you submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card, or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format. We encourage all stockholders to
vote electronically. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders
will vote your shares as you have directed. If you attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by
virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting in a virtual format unless you request and obtain a valid legal
proxy from your bank, broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Duck Creek Common Stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock represents a premium of:
•
approximately 46% over the closing stock price on January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 64% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
for the thirty (30) days ended January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Duck Creek encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated
by reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the
Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has
enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s) with
your proxy card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of this Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee and the other factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Recommendation and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement, and after
consultation with Duck Creek’s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it
advisable and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby approving
the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
order to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock
represented by such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock
certificates for the Merger Consideration to which you are entitled upon the consummation of the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank, trust or other nominee for instructions as to
how to effect the surrender of your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock
certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the Closing will include the
procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an affidavit that
you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as
indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Instead, Duck Creek will remain an independent public company, Duck Creek Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC on account of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Under certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement-Company Termination Fee” beginning on page 100 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Do any of Duck Creek’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of Company stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a
description of the interests of Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger” beginning
on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and
adopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the
Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and
arrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company
RSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a
 
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck
Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company
stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will
not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there
were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special
Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested
Company RSAs. Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
“stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you
by Duck Creek. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your
voting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
of those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares.
Without your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.
However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those
shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will
not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special
Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Michael A. Jackowski and Kevin
Rhodes, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following
ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
mailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you
have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote
by virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Your latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
If a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However,
if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be
voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with
respect to any other proposal.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 136,906,439
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of
132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. If you
submit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In
addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum; however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting
instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares
will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As
a result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,
the holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and
entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to
Duck Creek’s bylaws.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from
the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock and each of you notifies Duck Creek in writing of such special arrangements, you
will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom
you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares
at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the
close of business on the Record Date, you are encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy
card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the Internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the
Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time,
you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Duck Creek. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit
proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) as its proxy
solicitor. Innisfree will solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic
means. Under our agreement with Innisfree, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Innisfree will receive an
estimated fee not to exceed $45,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for its services
and plus fees for calls (if any) to Company stockholders. In addition, Innisfree and certain related persons will be
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Duck Creek has retained Broadridge to serve as independent inspector of elections in connection with the
Special Meeting. Duck Creek intends to notify Company stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by
issuing a press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Statement) who exchanges shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77
of this Proxy Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have
certain connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Duck Creek equity awards receive in the Merger?
At the Effective Time, each Company RSA, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSA
granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSU,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSU that
was granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSU prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company Phantom Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured by
reference to such Company Phantom Stock Award, multiplied by (B) $19.00.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company SAR will be cancelled immediately upon the
Effective Time without payment or consideration.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Duck Creek and Parent are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. Assuming the
timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Duck Creek’s stockholders of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the first half of
2023.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 22 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial
owners are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
based to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery.
Stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section
262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
is accessible, without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by reference herein to this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble
accessing the virtual meeting website?
A:
If Duck Creek experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the
virtual meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing
the virtual meeting website. Contact information for technical support will appear on the virtual meeting login
page prior to the start of the Special Meeting.

"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,22,31,None,"
This Proxy Statement, and the documents to which Duck Creek refers you in this Proxy Statement, as well as
information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Duck Creek or on Duck
Creek’s behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including but
not limited to, those statements related to the Merger, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected
timing, completion and effects of the Merger. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,”
“might,” “could,” “forecast,” “outlook” and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Merger, are based on the Company’s
current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to
inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
performance.
Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans,
estimates or expectations include but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the Merger on the anticipated terms and
timing, including obtaining required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions to
the completion of the Merger; (ii) potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the
Company or its directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (iii) the risk that
disruptions from the Merger (including the ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a
change of control) will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the
pendency of the Merger; (iv) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (v) potential adverse
reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger; (vi)
legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (vii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing
business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance;
(viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain
business opportunities or strategic transactions; (ix) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including
but not limited to, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; (x) the possibility that the Merger may be more
expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (xi) the occurrence of
any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in
circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; (xii) those risks and uncertainties set forth under the
headings “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by
other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov; and (xiii) the risks described in the Proxy Statement.
There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the
anticipated time period. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with
the other forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date on which
the statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-
looking statement except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to
be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements.
We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. You should
specifically consider the factors identified in this communication that could cause actual results to differ.
Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or
how they may affect the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE SPECIAL MEETING
Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to Company stockholders as a part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof. Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual format only at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, Company stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals to:
•
adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023 are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Duck Creek’s headquarters
located at 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, during regular business hours for a period of at least
ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and at the location of the Special Meeting during the Special Meeting. To
access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting website link set forth above.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. The presence of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a
quorum. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee generally has the
discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares
on “non-routine” matters. Because the Special Meeting Proposals presented to Company stockholders are
considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will
not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special
Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary,
we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present
for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will
have no effect on a particular proposal. However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your
 
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other
proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at
the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and
will not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Shares Held by Duck Creek’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. The directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote all of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Voting of Proxies
If your shares are registered in your name with Duck Creek’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you may cause your shares to be voted by submitting electronically over the Internet or by phone a
proxy authorizing the voting of your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the
enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not
have access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
postage-paid envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will
vote your shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held of record
by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual
format, your vote by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued
in your name from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we
encourage you to submit your proxy to vote your shares in advance of the Special Meeting.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed
proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions of the Company stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be
voted “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory
vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. No proxy that is specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in
favor of the proposed compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-
routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your
shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage
you to authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the Internet
or telephone through your broker, bank, trust or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other
nominee’s voting form, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee, it will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not
have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in
street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the
proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal,

The Special Meeting (page 23)
Date, Time and Place
The special meeting of Company stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023,
at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock of Duck Creek, par value
$0.01 per share (“Duck Creek Common Stock”), including unvested Company RSAs (as defined below), at the close
of business on February 9, 2023, the record date for the Special Meeting (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote
at the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the
Record Date.
Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on proposals
to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger (collectively, the
“Special Meeting Proposals”).
Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to
be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and
4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. The presence of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As a result, 68,453,220 shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock must be represented by proxy or by stockholders present and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting to have a quorum. Shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are counted as present if:
•
such shares are present in person at the virtual Special Meeting; or
•
a proxy card has been properly submitted by mail, by telephone or over the Internet with respect to such
shares.
If you submit your proxy card, regardless of whether you abstain from voting on one or more of the Special
Meeting Proposals, your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be counted as present at the Special Meeting for
the purpose of determining a quorum. If your shares are held in “street name,” your shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum if your broker, bank, trust or other nominee

TABLE OF CONTENTS
submits a proxy covering your shares. If you hold your shares in “street name” and do not give any instruction to
your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to how your shares should be voted at the Special Meeting, those shares
will not be entitled to vote on any Special Meeting Proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining a
quorum.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Special Meeting, provided
a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not
anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the
purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have
no effect on a particular proposal.
Share Ownership of Duck Creek’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote
all of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
How You Can Vote
You may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
1.
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
2.
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
3.
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
4.
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. To vote during the Special
Meeting, you must do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using
the 16-digit control number included in your proxy materials.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name, you are considered the
stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other
nominee, then the broker, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to
those shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said
to be held in “street name.” Street name holders generally cannot submit a proxy or vote their shares directly and
must instead instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares using the methods described
above. Because the proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee does not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your
2
TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a
voting instruction form with the Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the
other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a
quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were
given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to authorize your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting Proposals by following the
instructions provided on the enclosed voting instruction form to provide your instructions over the Internet, by
telephone or by signing, dating and returning the voting instruction form in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Please submit your
proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you do not have
access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may alternatively vote by signing, dating and returning the
enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you
properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders will vote your shares as you
have directed.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies (including those submitted via the
Internet, by telephone and by mail) received before the polls are closed at the Special Meeting, and not revoked or
superseded, will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no
direction is indicated on a proxy card, such shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the enclosed proxy
card according to the recommendation of Duck Creek’s board of directors (the “Board”) “FOR” both of the Special
Meeting Proposals.

Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger (page 72)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger
that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. These interests include the following:
•
the acceleration and cash out of certain equity-based awards held by Duck Creek’s executive officers and
members of the Board as of the Effective Time;
6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the entitlement of each of Duck Creek’s executive officers to receive payments and benefits under the
executive officer’s applicable employment agreement in the event of a qualifying termination of employment
(as described in the applicable executive officer’s employment agreement); and
•
the continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the
Surviving Corporation.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the
Merger” beginning on page 72 of this Proxy Statement for a more detailed description of these interests.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by Company stockholders, the shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock held by Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock held by all other Company stockholders entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration.
Financing of the Merger (page 76)
The obligation of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. In
connection with the financing of the Merger, Vista Fund VIII and Parent entered into an equity commitment letter,
dated as of January 8, 2023 (the “Equity Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, among other things, Vista Fund VIII
will provide Parent with an equity commitment of up to approximately $2.65 billion in cash, which will be available,
together with cash on hand at Duck Creek as of the Closing, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration (including
payments in respect of the Company’s outstanding equity-based awards payable in connection with the Closing
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) and to pay the fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the Closing by Duck Creek and the Buyer Parties. Duck Creek has a contractual right to enforce the
Equity Commitment Letter against Vista Fund VIII and, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Duck Creek has the
right to specifically enforce the Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Buyer Parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the limited guarantee delivered by Vista Fund VIII in favor of Duck Creek, dated as of January 8,
2023 (the “Limited Guarantee”), Vista Fund VIII agreed to guarantee the payment of all of the liabilities and
obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to $156,674,686, plus
amounts in respect of certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Buyer Parties for certain costs,
expenses or losses incurred or sustained by Duck Creek and its subsidiaries (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). For
more information, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Financing of the Merger” beginning on page 76 of this
Proxy Statement.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 77)
The receipt of cash by Company stockholders in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the
Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a Company
stockholder that is a U.S. Holder generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock surrendered in the Merger. Backup withholding may
also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding rules.
Company stockholders that are Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to the backup withholding rules described above unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from
backup withholding.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), has expired or been terminated.
For more information, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,”
beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement.
On January 18, 2023, the parties made the filings required under the HSR Act. The waiting period under the HSR
Act expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 17, 2023.
Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger (page 80)
On February 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01393 (referred to as the “O’Dell Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Karthik Reddiar v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01449 (referred to as the “Reddiar Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Tim Dangerfield v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01483 (referred to as the “Dangerfield Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
On February 23, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned Kimberly Powell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-
cv-01526 (referred to as the “Powell Complaint” and together with the O’Dell Complaint, the Reddiar Complaint and
the Dangerfield Complaint, the “Complaints”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger
(referred to as the “Preliminary Proxy Statement”) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and
information concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and
Evercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into
between Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek
and potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the
Complaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain
allegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the
terms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not
contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the
defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring
that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

Common Stock as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (iii) is not an affiliate of any person described in clause (i)
or (ii) above (each, an “Excluded Party”):
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constituted, or was reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal;
•
subject to entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person, furnish to any person
any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or
inquiry that constituted, or was reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; and
•
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any such Person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal.

Company is subject to customary “no-shop” restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative Acquisition Proposals
from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third
parties regarding any alternative Acquisition Proposals, subject to a customary “fiduciary out” provision that allows
the Company, under certain specified circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and
engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the Special Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such alternative Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
Company Board Recommendation Changes (page 92)
For purposes of this Proxy Statement, each of “Company Board Recommendation Change” and “Intervening
Event” is defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Company Board Recommendation
Changes” beginning on page 92 of this Proxy Statement.
As described above, the Board has made the recommendation that the Company stockholders vote “FOR” the

Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 92 of this Proxy Statement, prior to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the affirmative vote of each of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”), the Board, upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (1) there has been an Intervening Event;
or (2) the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Board may
only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (i) for an Intervening Event or (ii) in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if, in each case, the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and subject to additional requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including, in certain circumstances, payment of the Company Termination Fee.

Appraisal Rights (page 106)
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Company stockholders and beneficial owners who
continuously hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial owners may
be entitled to have their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”), and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of
Chancery, as described further below. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Company stockholders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock must: (1)
deliver a written demand for appraisal to Duck Creek before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (3)
continue to hold or beneficially own, as applicable, their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective
Time; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Duck Creek Common Stock unless certain stock
ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders and beneficial owners seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the
relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the
applicable statutory provisions are accessible, without subscription or cost, at the

following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. If you hold your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth
above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is
made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving
corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified listed required by Section 262(f) of the
DGCL.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the
Merger, the Merger Agreement and the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions
that may be important to you as a Company stockholder. You are encouraged to read carefully the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the annexes to this Proxy Statement and the documents we
refer to in this Proxy Statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 112 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On January 8, 2023, Duck Creek entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Duck Creek, with Duck Creek surviving the Merger as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the
Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board is furnishing this Proxy
Statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in connection with the solicitation
of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposal to be
voted on at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes
information that we are required to provide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting
on the matters presented at the Special Meeting. Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date may
attend the Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Duck Creek?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Duck Creek by Parent through the Merger of Merger Sub with and
into Duck Creek pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved
by the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck
Creek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek
expects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Duck Creek would no longer
be a publicly traded company, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of
Duck Creek Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $19.00 in
cash, without interest, for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For
example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, you will be entitled to receive
$1,900.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the
Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023, are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals
 
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to
vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are
described under the question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Company stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
•
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special
Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting
instruction form with this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to
the other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to
which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to
authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to
vote shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend
the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be
counted.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs, is entitled to cast one vote on
each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock, including
each unvested Company RSA, that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual meeting format only on the virtual meeting website. You will
not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. Once admitted to the Special Meeting,
stockholders may vote their shares and view a list of stockholders by following the instructions available on the
meeting website. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must do so by logging into
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control number included in your
proxy materials.
We recommend that you submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card, or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format. We encourage all stockholders to
vote electronically. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders
will vote your shares as you have directed. If you attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by
virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting in a virtual format unless you request and obtain a valid legal
proxy from your bank, broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Duck Creek Common Stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock represents a premium of:
•
approximately 46% over the closing stock price on January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 64% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
for the thirty (30) days ended January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Duck Creek encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated
by reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the
Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has
enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s) with
your proxy card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of this Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee and the other factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Recommendation and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement, and after
consultation with Duck Creek’s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it
advisable and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby approving
the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
order to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock
represented by such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock
certificates for the Merger Consideration to which you are entitled upon the consummation of the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank, trust or other nominee for instructions as to
how to effect the surrender of your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock
certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the Closing will include the
procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an affidavit that
you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as
indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Instead, Duck Creek will remain an independent public company, Duck Creek Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC on account of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Under certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement-Company Termination Fee” beginning on page 100 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Do any of Duck Creek’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of Company stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a
description of the interests of Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger” beginning
on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and
adopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the
Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and
arrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company
RSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a
 
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck
Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company
stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will
not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there
were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special
Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested
Company RSAs. Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
“stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you
by Duck Creek. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your
voting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
of those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares.
Without your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.
However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those
shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will
not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special
Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Michael A. Jackowski and Kevin
Rhodes, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following
ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
mailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you
have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote
by virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Your latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
If a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However,
if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be
voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with
respect to any other proposal.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 136,906,439
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of
132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. If you
submit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In
addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum; however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting
instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares
will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As
a result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,
the holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and
entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to
Duck Creek’s bylaws.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from
the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock and each of you notifies Duck Creek in writing of such special arrangements, you
will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom
you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares
at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the
close of business on the Record Date, you are encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy
card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the Internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the
Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time,
you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Duck Creek. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit
proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) as its proxy
solicitor. Innisfree will solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic
means. Under our agreement with Innisfree, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Innisfree will receive an
estimated fee not to exceed $45,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for its services
and plus fees for calls (if any) to Company stockholders. In addition, Innisfree and certain related persons will be
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Duck Creek has retained Broadridge to serve as independent inspector of elections in connection with the
Special Meeting. Duck Creek intends to notify Company stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by
issuing a press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Statement) who exchanges shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77
of this Proxy Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have
certain connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Duck Creek equity awards receive in the Merger?
At the Effective Time, each Company RSA, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSA
granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSU,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSU that
was granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSU prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company Phantom Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured by
reference to such Company Phantom Stock Award, multiplied by (B) $19.00.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company SAR will be cancelled immediately upon the
Effective Time without payment or consideration.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Duck Creek and Parent are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. Assuming the
timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Duck Creek’s stockholders of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the first half of
2023.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 22 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial
owners are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
based to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery.
Stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section
262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
is accessible, without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by reference herein to this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble
accessing the virtual meeting website?
A:
If Duck Creek experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the
virtual meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing
the virtual meeting website. Contact information for technical support will appear on the virtual meeting login
page prior to the start of the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Proxy Statement, and the documents to which Duck Creek refers you in this Proxy Statement, as well as
information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Duck Creek or on Duck
Creek’s behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including but
not limited to, those statements related to the Merger, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected
timing, completion and effects of the Merger. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,”
“might,” “could,” “forecast,” “outlook” and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Merger, are based on the Company’s
current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to
inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
performance.
Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans,
estimates or expectations include but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the Merger on the anticipated terms and
timing, including obtaining required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions to
the completion of the Merger; (ii) potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the
Company or its directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (iii) the risk that
disruptions from the Merger (including the ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a
change of control) will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the
pendency of the Merger; (iv) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (v) potential adverse
reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger; (vi)
legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (vii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing
business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance;
(viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain
business opportunities or strategic transactions; (ix) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including
but not limited to, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; (x) the possibility that the Merger may be more
expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (xi) the occurrence of
any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in
circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; (xii) those risks and uncertainties set forth under the
headings “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by
other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov; and (xiii) the risks described in the Proxy Statement.
There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the
anticipated time period. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with
the other forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date on which
the statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-
looking statement except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to
be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements.
We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. You should
specifically consider the factors identified in this communication that could cause actual results to differ.
Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or
how they may affect the Company.

"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum,23,32,Termination,"""Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023 are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Duck Creek’s headquarters
located at 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, during regular business hours for a period of at least
ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and at the location of the Special Meeting during the Special Meeting. To
access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting website link set forth above.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. The presence of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a
quorum. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee generally has the
discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares
on “non-routine” matters. Because the Special Meeting Proposals presented to Company stockholders are
considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will
not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special
Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal."""
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,23,32,None,"""
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary,
we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present
for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will
have no effect on a particular proposal. However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your

broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other
proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at

will not be voted with respect to any other proposal."""

of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. The directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote all of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and “FOR” the non-

proxy authorizing the voting of your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the
enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically

have access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
postage-paid envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will
vote your shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held of record
by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual

in your name from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we
encourage you to submit your proxy to vote your shares in advance of the Special Meeting.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed
proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions of the Company stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be
voted “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory
vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. No proxy that is specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in
favor of the proposed compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-
routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your
shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage
you to authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the Internet
or telephone through your broker, bank, trust or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other
nominee’s voting form, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee, it will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not
have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in
street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the
proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal,

then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be
voted with respect to any other proposal."""

You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format, by voting by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. If you hold your
shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
address above before the Special Meeting, which states that you have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote by ballot at
the Special Meeting for your previous proxy to be revoked. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must
do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control
number included in your proxy materials.
Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, Internet or telephonic voting instructions or written notice
of revocation must be received by Duck Creek’s Secretary prior to the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. You may also vote at the
Special Meeting by ballot if you register in advance to attend the Special Meeting following the procedures
described below and if you provide a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Any adjournment, recess or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies will allow Company stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to
their use at the Special Meeting which was adjourned, recessed or postponed.
Adjournments
If a quorum is not present or if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, Duck Creek expects that the Special Meeting will be adjourned by the chairman of the Special
Meeting pursuant to Duck Creek’s bylaws to solicit additional proxies in accordance with the Merger Agreement. At
any subsequent reconvening of the Special Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the manner in
which such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Special Meeting, except for any proxies
that have been validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned
meeting if announced at the Special Meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days or the Board fixes a new record date for the Special Meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Special Meeting.
Technical Difficulties or Trouble Accessing the Virtual Meeting Website
If Duck Creek experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the virtual
meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing
the virtual meeting website. Contact information for technical support will appear on the virtual meeting login page
prior to the start of the Special Meeting.

operated today and (B) Company stockholders will be subject to similar types of risks and uncertainties as
those to which they are currently subject, including but not limited to, risks and uncertainties with respect
to Duck Creek’s business, prospects or results of operations, as such may be affected by, among other
things, the highly competitive industry in which Duck Creek operates and adverse economic conditions;
•
the price of Duck Creek Common Stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain
when, if ever, the price of Duck Creek Common Stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the
date of this Proxy Statement;
•
the Board will continue to evaluate and review Duck Creek’s business operations, strategic direction and
capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate (irrespective of
these efforts, it is possible that no other transaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that Duck
Creek’s business, prospects or results of operations will be adversely impacted); and
•
under certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek will be required to pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more information, please see the section entitled

Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger (page 72)
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger
that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. These interests include the following:
•
the acceleration and cash out of certain equity-based awards held by Duck Creek’s executive officers and
members of the Board as of the Effective Time;
6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
the entitlement of each of Duck Creek’s executive officers to receive payments and benefits under the
executive officer’s applicable employment agreement in the event of a qualifying termination of employment
(as described in the applicable executive officer’s employment agreement); and
•
the continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the
Surviving Corporation.
See the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the
Merger” beginning on page 72 of this Proxy Statement for a more detailed description of these interests.
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by Company stockholders, the shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock held by Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock held by all other Company stockholders entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration.
Financing of the Merger (page 76)
The obligation of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition. In
connection with the financing of the Merger, Vista Fund VIII and Parent entered into an equity commitment letter,
dated as of January 8, 2023 (the “Equity Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, among other things, Vista Fund VIII
will provide Parent with an equity commitment of up to approximately $2.65 billion in cash, which will be available,
together with cash on hand at Duck Creek as of the Closing, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration (including
payments in respect of the Company’s outstanding equity-based awards payable in connection with the Closing
pursuant to the Merger Agreement) and to pay the fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the Closing by Duck Creek and the Buyer Parties. Duck Creek has a contractual right to enforce the
Equity Commitment Letter against Vista Fund VIII and, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Duck Creek has the
right to specifically enforce the Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Buyer Parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the limited guarantee delivered by Vista Fund VIII in favor of Duck Creek, dated as of January 8,
2023 (the “Limited Guarantee”), Vista Fund VIII agreed to guarantee the payment of all of the liabilities and
obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement, subject to an aggregate cap equal to $156,674,686, plus
amounts in respect of certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Buyer Parties for certain costs,
expenses or losses incurred or sustained by Duck Creek and its subsidiaries (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). For
more information, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Financing of the Merger” beginning on page 76 of this
Proxy Statement.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 77)
The receipt of cash by Company stockholders in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the
Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such receipt of cash by a Company
stockholder that is a U.S. Holder generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock surrendered in the Merger. Backup withholding may
also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding rules.
Company stockholders that are Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under the section entitled, “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with
respect to the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has
certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to the backup withholding rules described above unless
the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from
backup withholding.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 80)
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), has expired or been terminated.
For more information, please see the section entitled “The Merger-Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,”
beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement.
On January 18, 2023, the parties made the filings required under the HSR Act. The waiting period under the HSR
Act expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 17, 2023.
Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger (page 80)
On February 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, captioned O’Dell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01393 (referred to as the “O’Dell Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Karthik Reddiar v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01449 (referred to as the “Reddiar Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On
February 22, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, captioned Tim Dangerfield v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-
01483 (referred to as the “Dangerfield Complaint”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
On February 23, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, captioned Kimberly Powell v. Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-
cv-01526 (referred to as the “Powell Complaint” and together with the O’Dell Complaint, the Reddiar Complaint and
the Dangerfield Complaint, the “Complaints”), naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the proxy statement filed by Duck Creek with the SEC on February 16, 2023, in connection with the Merger
(referred to as the “Preliminary Proxy Statement”) contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and
information concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and
Evercore in support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into
between Duck Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek
and potential conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the
Complaints includes enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain
allegedly material information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the
terms thereof, granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to disseminate a proxy statement that does not
contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required or necessary material facts, directing the
defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring
that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ and
experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

continuing until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on February 7, 2023 (the “No-Shop Period Start Date”), the Company and its
representatives had the right to, solely with respect to any person that (i) did not make an Acquisition Proposal in the
five days prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) is not a holder of 10% or more of the total Duck Creek
Common Stock as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (iii) is not an affiliate of any person described in clause (i)
or (ii) above (each, an “Excluded Party”):
•
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constituted, or was reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal;
•
subject to entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person, furnish to any person
any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or
inquiry that constituted, or was reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; and
•
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any such Person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal.
From the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, from the date of the Merger
Agreement) until the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Company is subject to customary “no-shop” restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative Acquisition Proposals
from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third
parties regarding any alternative Acquisition Proposals, subject to a customary “fiduciary out” provision that allows
the Company, under certain specified circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and
engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if the Special Committee determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such alternative Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
Company Board Recommendation Changes (page 92)
For purposes of this Proxy Statement, each of “Company Board Recommendation Change” and “Intervening
Event” is defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Company Board Recommendation
Changes” beginning on page 92 of this Proxy Statement.
As described above, the Board has made the recommendation that the Company stockholders vote “FOR” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances and subject to
certain requirements described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Company Board
Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 92 of this Proxy Statement, prior to the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the affirmative vote of each of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock (the “Requisite Stockholder Approval”), the Board, upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if (1) there has been an Intervening Event;
or (2) the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Board may
only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (i) for an Intervening Event or (ii) in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if, in each case, the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and subject to additional requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including, in certain circumstances, payment of the Company Termination Fee.

under certain circumstances and prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction is

Appraisal Rights (page 106)
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, Company stockholders and beneficial owners who
continuously hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw their
demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection
with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial owners may
be entitled to have their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”), and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of
Chancery, as described further below. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, persons who wish to seek
appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of
the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
To exercise appraisal rights, Company stockholders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock must: (1)
deliver a written demand for appraisal to Duck Creek before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (3)
continue to hold or beneficially own, as applicable, their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective
Time; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. Failure to
follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the
Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of Duck Creek Common Stock unless certain stock
ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders and beneficial owners seeking appraisal. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights”
beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the
relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the
applicable statutory provisions are accessible, without subscription or cost, at the

beginning on page 112 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials?
A:
On January 8, 2023, Duck Creek entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub
with and into Duck Creek, with Duck Creek surviving the Merger as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the
Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board is furnishing this Proxy
Statement and form of proxy card to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in connection with the solicitation
of proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the other proposal to be
voted on at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This Proxy Statement includes
information that we are required to provide to you under the SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting
on the matters presented at the Special Meeting. Company stockholders of record as of the Record Date may
attend the Special Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the Special Meeting Proposals.
Q:
When and where is the Special Meeting?
A:
The Special Meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time online at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Q:
What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Duck Creek?
A:
The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Duck Creek by Parent through the Merger of Merger Sub with and
into Duck Creek pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved
by the requisite number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, and the other closing conditions under the
Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Duck Creek, with Duck
Creek continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Duck Creek will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer own shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek
expects to delist the Duck Creek Common Stock from Nasdaq and de-register the Duck Creek Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Thereafter, Duck Creek would no longer
be a publicly traded company, and Duck Creek will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of
Duck Creek Common Stock.
Q:
What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?
A:
Upon the consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $19.00 in
cash, without interest, for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock that you own, unless you have properly
exercised and perfected your demand for appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For
example, if you own one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, you will be entitled to receive
$1,900.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for your one hundred (100) shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
In either case, your shares will be canceled and you will not own nor be entitled to acquire shares in the
Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023, are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals
 
13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to
vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. Instructions on how to vote shares held in street name are
described under the question “How may I vote?” below.
Q:
How may I vote?
A:
For Company stockholders of record: If you are eligible to vote at the Special Meeting and are a stockholder of
record, you may cast your shares in any of four (4) ways:
•
by voting over the Internet using the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone using the toll-free number on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot.
For holders in street name: If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not
instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special
Meeting Proposals are “non-routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting
instruction form with this Proxy Statement. If you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to
the other proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to
which instructions were given, and will not be voted with respect to any other proposal. We encourage you to
authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form.
If you submit your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, and you do not subsequently revoke your proxy, your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting and vote by ballot, you are encouraged to vote your shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock by proxy. If you are a stockholder of record or if you obtain a valid legal proxy to
vote shares which you beneficially own and wish to change your vote, you may still vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you attend
the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by virtual ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be
counted.
Q:
How many votes do I have?
A:
Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs, is entitled to cast one vote on
each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock, including
each unvested Company RSA, that such holder owned as of the Record Date.
Q:
May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
A:
Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual meeting format only on the virtual meeting website. You will
not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. Once admitted to the Special Meeting,
stockholders may vote their shares and view a list of stockholders by following the instructions available on the
meeting website. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must do so by logging into
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control number included in your
proxy materials.
We recommend that you submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the
enclosed proxy card, or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided-even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format. We encourage all stockholders to
vote electronically. If you properly and timely submit your proxy, the individuals named as your proxy holders
will vote your shares as you have directed. If you attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format and vote by
virtual ballot, your vote by virtual ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If
14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
you hold your shares in street name, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting in a virtual format unless you request and obtain a valid legal
proxy from your bank, broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?
A:
You are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
•
to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of Duck Creek Common Stock prior to the
announcement of the Merger?
A:
The Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock represents a premium of:
•
approximately 46% over the closing stock price on January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement; and
•
approximately 64% over the volume weighted average stock price of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
for the thirty (30) days ended January 6, 2023, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the
Merger Agreement.
Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
Duck Creek encourages you to read the accompanying Proxy Statement, including all documents incorporated
by reference into the accompanying Proxy Statement, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety. Then as
promptly as possible, follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to submit your proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. We encourage all
stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a touch-tone phone or the
Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee has
enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. Please do not send your stock certificate(s) with
your proxy card. See “How may I vote?” in this section of this Proxy Statement for more information.
Q:
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:
On January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee and the other factors described in the section entitled “The Merger-
Recommendation and Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement, and after
consultation with Duck Creek’s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it
advisable and approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
thereunder, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby approving
the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Q:
Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?
A:
No. If you are a record holder, after the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you
will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock certificate(s) to the paying agent in
15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
order to receive the cash payment of the Merger Consideration for each share of Duck Creek Common Stock
represented by such stock certificate(s). You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock
certificates for the Merger Consideration to which you are entitled upon the consummation of the Merger. If you
hold your shares in “street name,” please contact your broker, bank, trust or other nominee for instructions as to
how to effect the surrender of your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Please do not send in your stock
certificates now.
Q:
If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, the transmittal materials you will receive after the Closing will include the
procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate(s). This will include an affidavit that
you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as
indemnity against any potential loss.
Q:
What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
A:
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by Company stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any
other reason, Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Instead, Duck Creek will remain an independent public company, Duck Creek Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports
with the SEC on account of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Under certain specified circumstances, Duck Creek may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee
upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement-Company Termination Fee” beginning on page 100 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Do any of Duck Creek’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may be in addition to or differ
from those of Company stockholders generally?
A:
Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. The Board was aware
of and considered these interests, to the extent such interests existed at the time, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company stockholders. For a
description of the interests of Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers in the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger” beginning
on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
Q:
Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
A:
Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
Merger, commonly referred to as “golden parachute” compensation. If the Merger Agreement is approved and
adopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is completed, this compensation may be paid to the
Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and
arrangements even if the Company stockholders fail to approve this proposal.
Q:
What vote is required to approve the proposals submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting?
A:
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company
RSAs, present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon at the Special
Meeting, provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a
 
16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck
Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than fifty
percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company
stockholders will be considered non-discretionary, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special
Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will
not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date for determining who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, there
were 136,906,439 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special
Meeting, consisting of 132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested
Company RSAs. Each holder of Duck Creek Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock owned by such holder as of the Record Date.
Q:
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
“stockholder of record.” In this case, this Proxy Statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you
by Duck Creek. As the stockholder of record you have the right to vote by proxy, which involves granting your
voting rights directly to Duck Creek or to a third party, or to vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
of those shares. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares.
Without your voting instructions, because of the non-routine nature of the Special Meeting Proposals, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the Special Meeting Proposals.
However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those
shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will
not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Q:
What is a proxy?
A:
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special
Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock is called a “proxy card.” The Board has designated Michael A. Jackowski and Kevin
Rhodes, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.
Q:
Can I change or revoke my proxy?
A:
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting, by voting by ballot at the Special Meeting.
If you hold your shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following
ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
17
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
mailing address on the first page of this Proxy Statement before the Special Meeting, which states that you
have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting virtually will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote
by virtual ballot at the virtual Special Meeting in order for your previous proxy to be revoked.
Your latest dated proxy card, Internet or telephone vote is the one that is counted.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Q:
If a Company stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares be voted?
A:
Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your
proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process
or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting
on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a
matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will
or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However,
if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee
with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal, then those shares will be
voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given and will not be voted with
respect to any other proposal.
Q:
I understand that a quorum is required in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. What constitutes a
quorum?
A:
The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting constitutes a quorum. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 136,906,439
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting, consisting of
132,892,979 shares of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 4,013,460 unvested Company RSAs. If you
submit a properly executed proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, you will be considered a part of the quorum. In
addition, abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be
counted for purposes of establishing a quorum; however, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting
instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, then those shares
will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. As
a result, 68,453,220 shares must be present or represented by proxy to have a quorum. If a quorum is not present,
the holders of a majority in voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, and
entitled to vote thereon, or the chairman of the Special Meeting, may adjourn the Special Meeting pursuant to
Duck Creek’s bylaws.
Q:
How can I obtain a proxy card?
A:
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, please follow the applicable procedure below.
For Company stockholders of record: Please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (877) 717-3923 (toll-free from
the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).
For holders in “street name”: Please contact your account representative at your broker, bank or other similar
institution.
Q:
What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A:
The Record Date is earlier than both the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
consummated. If you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the close of
18
TABLE OF CONTENTS
business on the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as the
provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock and each of you notifies Duck Creek in writing of such special arrangements, you
will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom
you sell or transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares
at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the
close of business on the Record Date, you are encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy
card or vote via the Internet or telephone.
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A:
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and
multiple proxy cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder
of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
Please vote via the Internet or telephone (or complete, date, sign and return) with respect to each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.
Q:
What happens if I sell my shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the
Effective Time?
A:
If you transfer your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock after the Special Meeting but before the Effective Time,
you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares
of Duck Creek Common Stock through the Effective Time.
Q:
Who will count the votes?
A:
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present.
Q:
Who will solicit votes for and bear the cost and expenses of this proxy solicitation?
A:
The cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by Duck Creek. Our directors, officers and employees may solicit
proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic means. We will pay these
directors, officers and employees no additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding this Proxy
Statement and related materials to, and obtaining instructions relating to such materials from, beneficial owners
of Duck Creek Common Stock. Duck Creek has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) as its proxy
solicitor. Innisfree will solicit proxies in person, by mail, telephone, facsimile and email, or by other electronic
means. Under our agreement with Innisfree, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Innisfree will receive an
estimated fee not to exceed $45,000 plus reimbursement of its reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for its services
and plus fees for calls (if any) to Company stockholders. In addition, Innisfree and certain related persons will be
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement.
Q:
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A:
Duck Creek has retained Broadridge to serve as independent inspector of elections in connection with the
Special Meeting. Duck Creek intends to notify Company stockholders of the results of the Special Meeting by
issuing a press release, which it will also file with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q:
Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash
pursuant to the Merger?
A:
The exchange of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Statement) who exchanges shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
such shares and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77
of this Proxy Statement), the Merger will generally not result in U.S. federal income tax to you unless you have
certain connections with the United States.
For a more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
entitled “The Merger-U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 77 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What will the holders of outstanding Duck Creek equity awards receive in the Merger?
At the Effective Time, each Company RSA, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSA,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSA
granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock subject to such Company RSU,
multiplied by (B) $19.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash amount relating to each Company RSU that
was granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same terms and
conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSU prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date.
At the Effective Time, each Company Phantom Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured by
reference to such Company Phantom Stock Award, multiplied by (B) $19.00.
At the Effective Time, each Company Option and Company SAR will be cancelled immediately upon the
Effective Time without payment or consideration.
Q:
When do you expect the Merger to be consummated?
A:
Duck Creek and Parent are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible. Assuming the
timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver (in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement) of other closing conditions, including approval by Duck Creek’s stockholders of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be completed in the first half of
2023.
Q:
Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
A:
Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. See the section entitled
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 22 of this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
A:
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that Company stockholders and beneficial
owners are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest
20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
based to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery.
Stockholders and beneficial owners who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in the section entitled
“Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 106 of this Proxy Statement, which is qualified in its entirety by Section
262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL
is accessible, without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and incorporated by reference herein to this Proxy
Statement.
Q:
What if during the check-in time or during the Special Meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble

TABLE OF CONTENTS
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Proxy Statement, and the documents to which Duck Creek refers you in this Proxy Statement, as well as
information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Duck Creek or on Duck
Creek’s behalf, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including but
not limited to, those statements related to the Merger, including financial estimates and statements as to the expected
timing, completion and effects of the Merger. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “project,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,” “predict,” “may,” “will,”
“might,” “could,” “forecast,” “outlook” and variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Merger, are based on the Company’s
current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to
inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
performance.
Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans,
estimates or expectations include but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the Merger on the anticipated terms and
timing, including obtaining required stockholder and regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions to
the completion of the Merger; (ii) potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the
Company or its directors, managers or officers, including the effects of any outcomes related thereto; (iii) the risk that
disruptions from the Merger (including the ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a
change of control) will harm the Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the
pendency of the Merger; (iv) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel; (v) potential adverse
reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger; (vi)
legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (vii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing
business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance;
(viii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain
business opportunities or strategic transactions; (ix) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including
but not limited to, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of war or hostilities or the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as
management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; (x) the possibility that the Merger may be more
expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; (xi) the occurrence of
any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger, including in
circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; (xii) those risks and uncertainties set forth under the
headings “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by
other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC’s website at
www.sec.gov; and (xiii) the risks described in the Proxy Statement.
There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the
anticipated time period. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with
the other forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date on which
the statements are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-
looking statement except as required by law, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to
be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-
looking statements.
We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. You should
specifically consider the factors identified in this communication that could cause actual results to differ.
Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or
how they may affect the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE SPECIAL MEETING
Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to Company stockholders as a part of the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof. Duck Creek will hold the Special Meeting in a virtual format only at
https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM.
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, Company stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on proposals to:
•
adopt the Merger Agreement; and
•
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023 are entitled to notice of
the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection in Duck Creek’s headquarters
located at 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, during regular business hours for a period of at least
ten (10) days before the Special Meeting and at the location of the Special Meeting during the Special Meeting. To
access the list during the Special Meeting, please use the virtual meeting website link set forth above.
The inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting will tabulate votes cast by proxy or by ballot at the
Special Meeting. The inspector of elections will also determine whether a quorum is present. The presence of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a
quorum. Shares that abstain from voting on any proposal will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
With respect to shares held in street name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee generally has the
discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on “routine” matters, but cannot vote such uninstructed shares
on “non-routine” matters. Because the Special Meeting Proposals presented to Company stockholders are
considered non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will
not be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special
Meeting, and otherwise will have no effect on a particular proposal.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested
Company RSAs, entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the total number of votes of Duck Creek Common Stock, including unvested Company RSAs,
present at the Special Meeting, or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at the Special Meeting,
provided a quorum is present, is required to approve, by means of a non-binding, advisory vote, the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. This means that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and the transaction contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, will be approved if the number of shares voted “FOR” such proposal is greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the total number of outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger and the proposal to
approve compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. Because both proposals presented to Company stockholders will be considered non-discretionary,
we do not anticipate any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes will not be considered present
for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not count as votes cast at the Special Meeting, and otherwise will
have no effect on a particular proposal. However, if you hold your shares in street name and give voting instructions
to your
 
23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the proposals, but give no instruction as to the other
proposal, then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at
the Special Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and
will not be voted with respect to any other proposal.
Shares Held by Duck Creek’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of February 9, 2023, the Record Date, Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and
were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 3,733,584 shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, consisting of 2,098,465 shares
of unrestricted Duck Creek Common Stock and 1,635,119 unvested Company RSAs, representing approximately 2.7%
of the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. We expect that Duck Creek’s directors and executive
officers will beneficially own and be entitled to vote a similar figure at the close of business on the date of the Special
Meeting. The directors and executive officers have informed Duck Creek that they currently intend to vote all of their
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal regarding compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Voting of Proxies
If your shares are registered in your name with Duck Creek’s transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you may cause your shares to be voted by submitting electronically over the Internet or by phone a
proxy authorizing the voting of your shares by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the
enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone. We encourage all stockholders to vote electronically. Alternatively, if you do not
have access to a touch-tone phone or the Internet, you may sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
postage-paid envelope provided. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will
vote your shares according to your directions.
If you plan to attend and desire to vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual format, you will be provided with a
virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. Please note that if your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held of record
by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, and you decide to attend and vote at the Special Meeting in a virtual
format, your vote by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting will not be effective unless you present a legal proxy, issued
in your name from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we
encourage you to submit your proxy to vote your shares in advance of the Special Meeting.
Voting instructions are included on your enclosed proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed
proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the
instructions of the Company stockholders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be
voted “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory
vote, compensation that will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. No proxy that is specifically marked against adoption of the Merger Agreement will be voted in
favor of the proposed compensation arrangements for Duck Creek’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, unless it is specifically marked “FOR” the approval of such proposal.
If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker, bank,
trust or other nominee how to vote your shares, then, because both of the Special Meeting Proposals are “non-
routine matters,” your broker, bank, trust or other nominee would not have discretionary authority to vote your
shares on the Special Meeting Proposals. If your shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are held in street name, your
broker, bank, trust or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction form with this Proxy Statement. We encourage
you to authorize your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” both of the Special Meeting
Proposals by following the instructions provided on the voting instruction form. If you do not vote via the Internet
or telephone through your broker, bank, trust or other nominee or do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other
nominee’s voting form, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote with a proxy from your broker, bank, trust or
other nominee, it will be counted as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and will not
have any effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in
street name and give voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with respect to one of the
proposals, but give no instruction as to the other proposal,
24
TABLE OF CONTENTS
then those shares will be deemed present at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Special
Meeting, will be voted as instructed with respect to the proposal as to which instructions were given, and will not be
voted with respect to any other proposal.
How you May Revoke or Change Your Vote
You may change or revoke your previously submitted proxy at any time before the Special Meeting or, if you
attend the Special Meeting in a virtual format, by voting by virtual ballot at the Special Meeting. If you hold your
shares as a record holder, you may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
•
by re-voting at a subsequent time by Internet or by telephone following the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card;
•
by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by delivering a signed revocation letter to Christopher Stone, Duck Creek’s Secretary, at Duck Creek’s
address above before the Special Meeting, which states that you have revoked your proxy; or
•
by attending the Special Meeting in a virtual format and voting by virtual ballot. Attending the Special
Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically vote by ballot at
the Special Meeting for your previous proxy to be revoked. To vote during the Special Meeting, you must
do so by logging into https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/DCT2023SM using the 16-digit control
number included in your proxy materials.
Please note that to be effective, your new proxy card, Internet or telephonic voting instructions or written notice
of revocation must be received by Duck Creek’s Secretary prior to the Special Meeting.
If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your voting
instructions by following the instructions of your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. You may also vote at the
Special Meeting by ballot if you register in advance to attend the Special Meeting following the procedures
described below and if you provide a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.
Any adjournment, recess or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies will allow Company stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to
their use at the Special Meeting which was adjourned, recessed or postponed.
Adjournments
If a quorum is not present or if there are not sufficient votes for the approval of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, Duck Creek expects that the Special Meeting will be adjourned by the chairman of the Special
Meeting pursuant to Duck Creek’s bylaws to solicit additional proxies in accordance with the Merger Agreement. At
any subsequent reconvening of the Special Meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the manner in
which such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the Special Meeting, except for any proxies
that have been validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent meeting.
If the Special Meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned
meeting if announced at the Special Meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days or the Board fixes a new record date for the Special Meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Special Meeting.
Technical Difficulties or Trouble Accessing the Virtual Meeting Website
If Duck Creek experiences technical difficulties during the Special Meeting (e.g., a temporary or prolonged power
outage), it will determine whether the Special Meeting can be promptly reconvened (if the technical difficulty is
temporary) or whether the Special Meeting will need to be reconvened on a later day (if the technical difficulty is
more prolonged). In any such situation, Duck Creek will promptly notify stockholders of the decision via the virtual
meeting website.
Technical support will be ready to assist you with any individual technical difficulties you may have accessing

senior management have, from time to time, considered various strategic alternatives, including the continued
execution of the Company’s strategy as a stand-alone public company or the possible sale of the Company to, or
combination of the Company with, a third party.
On August 2, 2022, Mr. Wright, Chairman of the Board and a partner at Apax Partners, LLP (collectively, with its
affiliates, “Apax”), met for dinner with a representative of a private equity firm (“PE Firm A”), at which they discussed
the Company generally. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
Following an introduction by Mr. Wright, Mr. Jackowski, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and
representatives of another private equity firm (“PE Firm B”) met on August 15, 2022, via videoconference, and

transaction were discussed.
On August 17, 2022, at the request of another private equity firm (“PE Firm C”), Mr. Jackowski and a
representative of PE Firm C met via videoconference and discussed the insurance software industry generally, and

discussed.
On August 19, 2022, representatives of PE Firm A and a portfolio company owned by PE Firm A (“Company A”)
had an introductory call with Mr. Wright, during which they discussed, on a high-level and preliminary basis, the
potential interest of PE Firm A and Company A in exploring a strategic transaction with the Company. No terms of a
potential transaction were discussed.
On August 30, 2022, Mr. Jackowski met with the chief executive officer of Company A via video conference. The
meeting consisted of an introduction between Mr. Jackowski and the chief executive officer of Company A and a
high-level acknowledgment between them that the two companies could be interested in exploring a potential
strategic transaction. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On September 21, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, met in
person with representatives of PE Firm B, and attended a dinner together following their meeting. The discussions at
the meeting and at the dinner were introductory in nature. The parties discussed on a high level PE Firm B’s potential
interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were
discussed.
On September 22, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with the chief executive officer, chief
financial officer and chief products officer of Company A and representatives of PE Firm A. The discussions at the
meeting were preliminary in nature. The parties discussed on a high level the possibility of a strategic transaction
involving the Company, PE Firm A and Company A. The representatives at the meeting also discussed, at a high
level, certain changes the Company could implement in its expenditures, including its investment in new products, if
it ceased to be a public company. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
As a follow-up to the meeting between Mr. Jackowski and a representative of PE Firm C on August 17, 2022, a
representative of PE Firm C called Mr. Jackowski on September 26, 2022 to discuss on a high level

TABLE OF CONTENTS
PE Firm C’s potential interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. On September 27, 2022, Mr.
Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with representatives of PE Firm C to further discuss their interest in the Company. No
terms of a potential transaction were discussed at either of these meetings.
On October 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board and representatives of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), the Company’s outside legal counsel, in attendance. At the meeting,
Mr. Wright updated the Board on the indications of interest that had been received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B and PE
Firm C in exploring a potential transaction with the Company. Mr. Jackowski updated the Board on the meetings Mr.
Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes held with representatives of PE Firm B on September 21, 2022, with PE Firm A and
Company A on September 22, 2022, and with PE Firm C on September 26, 2022 and on September 27, 2022. Mr.
Jackowski informed the Board that no non-public information had been shared with such parties and that there had
not been any discussion with any party about the Company’s valuation, the price or terms of any potential
transaction, or the potential role of the Company’s current management after a potential transaction.
During the meeting, Mr. Wright stated that Apax would be supportive of a potential sale of the Company, if it
were on attractive terms. Mr. Nicoll, a member of the Board and a managing director of Accenture plc (“Accenture
plc”), stated that Accenture plc would be supportive of exploring potential third-party interest in the Company. The
Board determined that it was supportive of conducting further discussions and explorations of third-party interest in
the Company. The Board determined to establish an ad hoc transaction committee of the Board (the “Transaction
Committee”) to work with management in exploring potential interest in a strategic transaction involving the
Company. The Board appointed Mr. Bloom, Mr. Nicoll and Mr. Wright to the Transaction Committee based on their
experience with respect to strategic transactions and their availability. The Board did not delegate any decision-
making authority to the Transaction Committee. During the meeting, representatives of Skadden reviewed with the
Board its fiduciary duties in the event the Board were to pursue a change in control transaction.
During the same meeting, the Board discussed whether to engage a financial advisor to assist Company
management and the Board in identifying other parties that might have interest in a strategic transaction involving
the Company. The Board considered the Company’s existing investment banking relationships and the qualifications
of those investment banks. The Board authorized the Company’s management and the Transaction Committee to
contact J.P. Morgan for assistance with the exploratory process for a strategic transaction, based on J.P. Morgan’s
qualifications and experience advising, and familiarity with, companies operating in the same industry as the
Company.
At this meeting, Company management updated the Board on the status of management’s preparation of a long-
range plan for the Company. The Board discussed with management the assumptions to be included in a long-range
plan, including with respect to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth rates. The Board authorized management to
engage an internationally recognized consulting firm with expertise in the Company’s industry to assist Company
management in further developing the assumptions which would serve as the basis for the Company’s long-range
plan.
Later, on October 3, 2022, at the request of the Board, Mr. Wright contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to
discuss the potential engagement of J.P. Morgan by the Company in connection with the Company’s evaluation of a
potential strategic transaction. Mr. Wright informed the J.P. Morgan representatives that the Company had received
unsolicited indications of interest from PE Firm A, PE Firm B and, PE Firm C. Mr. Wright requested that J.P. Morgan
identify additional strategic parties and financial parties that the Company could consider contacting to solicit
indications of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company.
On October 6, 2022, Mr. Jackowski held a meeting with representatives of Vista, during which they discussed the
insurance software industry generally, and potential opportunities for Vista and the Company to work together. No
terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On October 11, 2022, Mr. Wright held a meeting with a representative of another private equity firm (“PE Firm D”)
on matters not related to the Company, during which they briefly discussed the Company generally and PE Firm D’s
potential interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were
discussed.
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On October 18, 2022, at the request of Vista, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with two representatives from
Vista. Mr. Jackowski and the Vista representatives met in person, and Mr. Rhodes joined the meeting via
videoconference. The parties discussed on a high-level Vista’s interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction
involving the Company. No terms of a potential transaction were discussed.
On October 27, 2022, Vista submitted an oral, non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in
cash.
Between October 3, 2022 and November 30, 2022, J.P. Morgan, together with members of the Transaction
Committee and Company management, identified strategic parties and financial parties that the Company could
consider contacting to solicit indications of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company. The
Transaction Committee directed J.P. Morgan to contact approximately 17 strategic and financial parties, including
Vista, PE Firm A, Company A, PE Firm B, PE Firm C and PE Firm D, to assess (or follow up on, in the case of potential
counterparties who had already been in contact with the Company) their interest in exploring a potential strategic
transaction involving the Company. During that period, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes also met with a number of
those potential counterparties to discuss at a high level the Company’s business and, on a preliminary and high-level
basis, the party’s interest in a potential transaction involving the Company. In those initial meetings, no non-public
information regarding the Company was shared and no terms of any potential transaction were discussed. These
initial meetings included a meeting on October 18, 2022 among Mr. Jackowski, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of
Vista, and a meeting on November 4, 2022 between Mr. Jackowski and a representative of Vista. In addition, on
October 26, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with investment professionals from Vista at an investor
conference, which was unrelated to any potential transaction, and no potential transaction was discussed.
On November 2, 2022, the chief executive officer of another strategic party (“Company B”), which was among
the parties contacted by J.P. Morgan after the Board meeting on October 3, 2022, contacted J.P. Morgan to request a
management presentation from the Company and requested that Company B be sent a draft confidentiality
agreement. The Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Company B on November 8, 2022, which
included customary standstill provisions (which standstill terminated, in accordance with its terms, upon the
Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement).
On November 14, 2022, Mr. Wright met with representatives of PE Firm A to discuss, on a preliminary basis, a
potential strategic transaction among the Company, PE Firm A and Company A. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also
attended this meeting on behalf of the Company. During the course of the meeting, representatives of PE Firm A
presented various preliminary and high-level financial data generated by PE Firm A regarding a potential strategic
transaction, including PE Firm A’s suggestion that a combination of the Company with Company A could potentially
result in meaningful synergies. PE Firm A’s presentation posited an illustrative offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in cash. The parties present at the meeting did not discuss PE Firm A’s preliminary views in
detail; however, Mr. Wright and the J.P. Morgan representatives informed PE Firm A that although the Board had not
previously discussed any potential offer price, it was their expectation that an offer price would need to be
significantly higher than $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock in order for the Board to consider a sale of
the Company. The parties present at the meeting discussed at a high level, among other things, that, if the Company
and Company A were to combine, they would together be able to make larger investments in product development.
No other terms of any potential transaction, business plans or financial or other analyses or proposals were
discussed.
On November 16, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with representatives of PE Firm C. During
the meeting, representatives of PE Firm C informed Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes that PE Firm C was not interested
in pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company at this time, but could be interested in providing funding to a
potential acquirer of the Company if such an opportunity were to arise in the future.
In the afternoon of November 16, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met in person with representatives of
Company B. At the meeting, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes presented an overview of certain publicly available
information about the Company and its business, and the parties present at the meeting discussed the insurance
software industry generally.
On November 18, 2022, representatives of another private equity firm (“PE Firm E”) met with Mr. Jackowski and
Mr. Rhodes to discuss PE Firm E’s preliminary interest in a strategic transaction involving the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On November 21, 2022, Mr. Jackowski, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of J.P. Morgan, and on November 22,
2022, Mr. Rhodes and representatives of J.P. Morgan, held additional financial and technology due diligence sessions
with representatives of Company B.
On November 22, 2022, PE Firm A submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary indicative offer price range of $16.25-$16.50 per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in cash. PE Firm A’s indication of interest stated that the transaction, if completed, would be
structured as an acquisition of the Company by Company A.
On November 28, 2022, PE Firm D and another private equity firm (“PE Firm F”), which had been contacted as
part of J.P. Morgan’s outreach to potential counterparties after the October 3, 2022 meeting of the Board, informed
representatives of J.P. Morgan verbally of their preliminary interest in jointly pursuing a strategic transaction with the
Company, together with one of their shared portfolio companies, and provided J.P. Morgan with a non-binding,
preliminary offer price range of $14.00-$16.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash.
On November 30, 2022, another private equity firm (“PE Firm G”) submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication
of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary indicative offer price range of $14.00-
$16.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash.
On November 30, 2022, PE Firm E informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that PE Firm E intended to submit a
non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary
indicative offer price range of $15.00-$18.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash, and that PE Firm E
would submit a written letter to the Company with its proposal following the meeting of its internal investment
committee to approve the proposal. On December 4, 2022, PE Firm E submitted this proposal in writing.
On November 30, 2022, the Transaction Committee held a meeting with all members of the Transaction Committee
and with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. At the meeting, J.P. Morgan representatives
updated the Transaction Committee on the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties and the non-binding
indications of interest that had been received to date. During the meeting, Mr. Wright informed the Transaction
Committee that, subject to Apax’s investment committee’s approval, a different Apax fund than the fund owning
Duck Creek Common Stock might be interested in investing in the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving
the Company if the Board determined to pursue a sale of the Company to PE Firm A and Company A (but would not
be interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty), which interest was new and
therefore had not previously been raised with the Transaction Committee or the Board. Mr. Wright further informed
the Transaction Committee that PE Firm A was not yet aware of such Apax fund’s potential interest and that there had
not been any discussions between Apax and PE Firm A regarding the potential participation of an Apax fund as an
investor in such a transaction. Mr. Wright further informed the other members of the Transaction Committee that
Apax’s investment committee was scheduled to discuss the matter on December 5, 2022, and that Mr. Wright would
update the full Board on Apax’s decision, so that the Board could, if appropriate, determine to implement any
appropriate decision-making procedures (including the potential recusal of Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie, the Apax-
nominated directors on the Board, from a strategic alternatives review process). During the meeting, Skadden
representatives reviewed with the Transaction Committee the fiduciary duties of directors when considering a change
in control transaction, recent trends in regulatory review of mergers and acquisitions, and procedural protections the
Board could consider if certain directors had interests in a potential transaction that differed from the interests of the
Company’s other stockholders.
On December 1, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board, except Mr. Rajasekar, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Skadden in attendance. During the meeting, J.P. Morgan representatives updated
the Board on the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties and the non-binding indications of interest that
had been received to date. During the meeting, Skadden representatives also reviewed with the Board the fiduciary
duties of directors in considering a change in control transaction, procedural protections the Board could consider in
the event that certain directors had an interest in a transaction that differed from the interests of the Company’s other
stockholders, and how the Board should evaluate closing uncertainty and regulatory risk in determining the value to
Company stockholders of any proposal. During the meeting, the Board instructed Mr. Jackowski to, and to cause
management to, refrain from engaging in any discussions with potential counterparties with respect to any post-
closing employment or equity participation, none of which had occurred to date. Mr. Wright informed the Board that,
subject to Apax’s investment committee’s approval, a
33
TABLE OF CONTENTS
different Apax fund than the fund owning Duck Creek Common Stock may potentially be interested in investing in
the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving the Company if the Board determined to pursue a sale to PE Firm
A and Company A (but would not be interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty),
and that Mr. Wright would update the Board following a meeting of Apax’s investment committee on December 5,
2022 to discuss the matter, so that the Board could, if appropriate, determine to implement appropriate decision-
making procedures (including the potential recusal of Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie, the Apax-nominated directors
on the Board, from a strategic alternatives process).
At this meeting, Mr. Jackowski also updated the Board on the continuing work by Company management to use
the draft long-range plan to develop the Stand-Alone Projections (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-
Forecasts” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement). The Board discussed and provided input on the draft
Stand-Alone Projections, asked for more detail in various areas and instructed Company management to prepare and
circulate a further revised draft of the Stand-Alone Projections incorporating the Board’s input in advance of the next
meeting of the Board, scheduled for December 4, 2022.
On December 4, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan
and Skadden in attendance. The Board reviewed with Company management the further revised draft of the Stand-
Alone Projections, and Mr. Rhodes explained the modifications that had been made in the current draft based on the
Board’s questions and comments at its prior meeting. Mr. Jackowski reviewed certain metrics with the Board,
including 2022 revenue of the Company, the Company’s estimated 2023 revenue, and how revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA in 2022 and estimated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 compared with models prepared by the
Company in connection with its IPO. The Board requested additional detail and comparisons from Company
management to review before approving the draft Stand-Alone Projections. At the meeting, J.P. Morgan
representatives reviewed with the Board the status of the outreaches to potential counterparties. Skadden
representatives further discussed with the Board certain procedural protections the Board could consider if an Apax
fund, with the approval of the Apax investment committee determined it were interested in investing in a buyer group
for a strategic transaction.
On December 5, 2022, the Board held a meeting with all members of the Board and representatives of J.P. Morgan
and Skadden in attendance. Mr. Wright informed the Board that an Apax fund, with the approval of the Apax
investment committee, had determined to evaluate whether such Apax fund would be interested in potentially
pursuing an investment in the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving the Company with PE Firm A and
Company A, if the Board determined to pursue a sale of the Company to PE Firm A and Company A (but would not
be interested in investing in a buyer group with any other potential counterparty). In light of an Apax fund’s interest
in evaluating whether to pursue such a transaction, the Board determined to dissolve the Transaction Committee and
establish a special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) comprised of independent and disinterested
directors of the Board. The Board appointed Mr. Bloom, Ms. Dodd and Mr. Nicoll to serve as members of the Special
Committee. In selecting Mr. Nicoll to serve on the Special Committee and concluding that he was disinterested and
independent, the Board considered Mr. Nicoll’s affiliation with Accenture plc, and the fact that Mr. Nicoll, on behalf
of Accenture plc, had indicated during the Board meeting held on October 3, 2022 that Accenture plc was not
interested in participating in a potential transaction as a buyer. The Board delegated to the Special Committee the
power and authority of the Board, to the fullest extent permitted by law and the Company’s bylaws, to consider,
negotiate and evaluate the terms, conditions and advisability of any strategic transaction involving the Company, to
oversee negotiations of any strategic transaction, and to reject any strategic transaction. The Board resolutions
forming the Special Committee also provided that the Board would not approve any strategic transaction, or
recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve any strategic transaction, that was not recommended by the
Special Committee. The Board also granted the Special Committee the authority to engage, at the Company’s expense,
its own legal, investment banking, accounting and other advisors or consultants to assist the Special Committee as
the Special Committee determined appropriate in its sole discretion.
At this meeting, after further review of the information requested by the Board from Company management at its
meeting on December 4, 2022 and after further discussion, the Board approved the Stand-Alone Projections.
Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie then left the meeting, and J.P. Morgan representatives presented to the rest of the
Board J.P. Morgan’s preliminary financial analyses of the Company, including analyses based on the Stand-Alone
Projections. J.P. Morgan representatives also updated the Board on the outreaches to potential counterparties to
date, and the indications of interest received to date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On December 5, 2022 and December 6, 2022, representatives of Apax, including Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie,
met with representatives of PE Firm A, who are also members of the board of directors of Company A, to discuss at a
preliminary and high level the possibility of a potential equity investment by an Apax fund in Company A in
connection with a strategic transaction among PE Firm A, Company A and the Company. The discussions were
exploratory in nature, and were part of the Apax fund’s evaluation of whether such Apax fund would be interested in
potentially pursuing an investment in a strategic transaction involving the Company with PE Firm A and Company A.
Apax representatives later informed the Special Committee of such discussions.
On December 6, 2022, Mr. Rhodes held an introductory call with representatives of another private equity firm
(“PE Firm H”), which had been contacted as part of J.P. Morgan’s outreaches to potential counterparties after the
October 3, 2022 meeting of the Board, to discuss at a high level the Company’s business and the insurance software
industry generally. No non-public information regarding the Company was shared and no terms of any potential
transaction were discussed.
The Special Committee considered recommendations for law firms and interviewed law firms seeking to act as
independent counsel to the Special Committee. After considering presentations of these law firms to the Special
Committee, and the respective qualifications, reputation and experience of these and other law firms, on December 7,
2022, the Special Committee selected Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul, Weiss”) to act as its
independent legal counsel.
On December 8, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting with all members of the Special Committee and
representatives of Paul, Weiss in attendance, to discuss initial matters to facilitate the Special Committee’s oversight
of the process for exploring a potential strategic transaction involving the Company, including the engagement by
the Special Committee of an independent financial advisor.
The Special Committee discussed the benefits of engaging J.P. Morgan as the Company’s financial advisor and
the need to understand if any of J.P. Morgan’s relationships with the Company, Apax and the other potential
counterparties could adversely affect J.P. Morgan’s ability to act as an unconflicted advisor. After this discussion,
representatives of J.P. Morgan joined the meeting and updated the Special Committee on the status of the outreaches
to potential counterparties and the non-binding indications of interest J.P. Morgan and the Company had received.
The Special Committee interviewed the J.P. Morgan representatives about J.P. Morgan’s past engagements with, and
the fees J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have earned from, the Company, Apax and certain other potential counterparties
to a strategic transaction, the percentage of J.P. Morgan’s revenues derived from work for private equity sponsors,
and J.P. Morgan’s perspectives on designing a process that would maximize stockholder value. The J.P. Morgan
representatives left the meeting and then provided to the Special Committee, in writing, disclosure of relationships
between J.P. Morgan and its affiliates on the one hand, and the Company, Apax and certain other potential
counterparties to a strategic transaction, on the other hand, that the J.P. Morgan representatives discussed with the
Special Committee during the meeting. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee determined that,
based on J.P. Morgan’s disclosures, J.P. Morgan’s relationships with potential counterparties, including Apax, should
not adversely affect J.P. Morgan’s ability to act as an unconflicted financial advisor for the Company in respect of its
evaluation of a potential transaction and that the Special Committee supported J.P. Morgan being engaged as the
financial advisor of the Company. The Special Committee also determined that it would engage a second financial
advisor who had no prior involvement with the process to date to serve as the independent financial advisor to the
Special Committee, and decided to interview two different financial advisors, including Evercore Group L.L.C.
(“Evercore”), regarding their qualifications and experience, and relationships with the Company, Apax and the other
potential counterparties, for the potential engagement.
On December 8, 2022, representatives of Paul, Weiss contacted legal counsel for Apax to discuss the possibility
of a potential equity investment by an Apax fund in Company A in connection with a strategic transaction among PE
Firm A, Company A and the Company. Legal counsel for Apax advised Paul, Weiss of the disclosure obligations
under Regulation 13D of the Apax fund through which Apax owns Duck Creek Common Stock and informed Paul,
Weiss that any such potential equity investment would be undertaken by a new fund as a new investment and that
the Apax fund owning Duck Creek Common Stock would intend to sell its shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in a
transaction recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board. Representatives of Paul, Weiss and legal counsel for Apax also discussed the applicability of the restrictions
on business combinations with interested stockholders under Section 203 of the DGCL (“Section 203”), which could
apply to any potential counterparty bidding jointly with an Apax fund, unless the Board granted the counterparty a
waiver in advance.
On December 9, 2022 and December 10, 2022, following discussions with Paul, Weiss, the Special Committee
provided the other members of the Board (excluding Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie) and certain members of the
Company’s management with internal communications guidelines to protect the confidentiality of the Special
Committee’s process and ensure that the Special Committee would be able to negotiate with potential counterparties
vigorously on an arms’ length basis and effectively execute its mandate. The Special Committee instructed such
parties to refrain from discussing the potential strategic transaction or the Special Committee’s process with, and not
to provide any information to, any potential counterparty to a transaction involving the Company, including Apax
and Apax-nominated directors, without first consulting with the Special Committee.
The Special Committee and representatives of Paul, Weiss met on December 12, 2022 to interview
representatives of one potential financial advisor, and on December 13, 2022, to interview representatives of Evercore.
In each interview, the Special Committee asked representatives of the financial advisors questions regarding their
qualifications and experience in special committee engagements in similar transactions, their past engagements with,
and the fees they and their affiliates have earned from, the Company, Apax and the other potential counterparties to a
strategic transaction, and their perspectives on designing a process that would maximize stockholder value, and
discussed with representatives of the financial advisors their answers. After the conclusion of Evercore’s interview,
the Special Committee discussed with Paul, Weiss the qualifications and experience, and relationship disclosure, of
each financial advisor.
On December 13, 2022, the Special Committee met again with representatives of Paul, Weiss also in attendance
to further discuss the interviews the Special Committee had conducted with representatives of Evercore and
representatives of the other potential financial advisor. Following this discussion, the Special Committee determined
that it would engage Evercore as its independent financial advisor, based on Evercore’s qualifications and experience
advising special committees in circumstances similar to that of the Special Committee, Evercore’s experience advising,
and familiarity with, companies in the same industry as the Company and the Special Committee’s determination that
Evercore’s relationships with potential counterparties, including Apax, should not adversely affect Evercore’s ability
to act as an unconflicted financial advisor for the Special Committee in respect of its evaluation of a potential
transaction. The Special Committee directed Paul, Weiss to notify Evercore, J.P. Morgan and the other potential
financial advisor the Special Committee had interviewed of the Special Committee’s decision to engage Evercore as
the Special Committee’s independent financial advisor.
During its December 13, 2022 meeting, the Special Committee also discussed the importance of confidentiality
and deliberate management of information flow to potential counterparties in order to structure a process that would
maximize stockholder value. The Special Committee also reviewed with Paul, Weiss the obligations of the Apax fund
through which Apax owns Duck Creek Common Stock under Regulation 13D to make public filings disclosing certain
changes in its plans or proposals regarding its investment in the Company and the restrictions on business
combinations with interested stockholders under Section 203, which could apply to any potential counterparty
bidding jointly with Apax, unless the Board granted the counterparty a waiver in advance. The Special Committee
considered, among other things, whether to request that Apax cease discussions of a strategic transaction with PE
Firm A, Company A and any other potential counterparty until further notice; whether Apax’s ceasing such
discussions would be likely to decrease the amount PE Firm A and Company A would be willing to offer in any
proposal for a strategic transaction; and whether permitting the discussions to continue would increase the risk of a
market leak that could harm the Company’s relations with its customers and employees or decrease competitive
dynamics of the process.
Representatives of Apax informed the Special Committee that on December 14, 2022, Apax and Company A
entered into a confidentiality agreement with each other, following which, representatives of Apax attended a
management presentation about Company A by representatives of Company A. Representatives of Apax informed
the Special Committee that only information relating to the business of Company A was presented and discussed at
the meeting and that Apax continued to comply with its confidentiality obligations to the Company restricting the
disclosure of any confidential information of the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Following Evercore’s selection as the Special Committee’s independent financial advisor on December 13, 2022,
and J.P. Morgan’s selection as the Company’s financial advisor on the same day, representatives of Evercore and of
J.P. Morgan met from time to time, separately from each other, with members of Company management to review
information regarding the Company, including the Stand-Alone Projections. Each financial advisor also continued to
work separately to refine its preliminary financial analyses of the Company based on, at the direction of the Board, in
the case of J.P. Morgan, and at the direction of the Special Committee, in the case of Evercore, the Stand-Alone
Projections.
On December 14, 2022, Paul, Weiss, at the direction of the Special Committee, contacted Apax’s legal counsel to
inform them that the Special Committee requested that Apax cease all discussions and communications with PE Firm
A and Company A, and any other parties, relating to a strategic transaction involving the Company, until further
notice.
On the same day, Mr. Wright received an unsolicited inbound request from another private equity firm (“PE Firm
I”) to discuss its potential interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving the Company. Mr. Wright did not
respond to PE Firm I’s inbound request and forwarded the request to representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan.
On December 15, 2022, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan
discussed with representatives of Apax, and separately, representatives of Paul, Weiss discussed with Apax’s legal
counsel, the Special Committee’s request that Apax cease discussions with PE Firm A and Company A.
Representatives of Apax informed the Company that later that day, representatives of Apax would inform
representatives of PE Firm A and Company A that the Special Committee had requested that Apax, PE Firm A and
Company A cease further discussions of a strategic transaction among them involving the Company, and cease
further sharing of information by Company A, pending the Special Committee’s consent to further discussions. Each
of Apax, PE Firm A and Company A agreed that day to abide by the Special Committee’s request at that time, and PE
Firm A and Company A confirmed to the Special Committee that they had not had discussions with Apax about a
strategic transaction since December 8, 2022.
On December 15, 2022, Vista submitted a written, non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, including a preliminary offer price range of $16.00-$18.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock, in cash.
Also on December 15, 2022, the Company publicly announced its intention to release its financial results for the
fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022 on January 5, 2023, and to hold an earnings call with analysts on that day.
On December 16, 2022, at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore provided customary
relationship disclosures to the Special Committee, which included disclosure of certain relationships between
Evercore and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, Apax, Accenture plc and their respective affiliates and
portfolio companies, as applicable, on the other hand.
Also on December 16, 2022, representatives of Apax, Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Apax’s legal
counsel had further discussions about Apax’s continued requests to permit an Apax fund to engage in discussions
with PE Firm A and Company A and conduct due diligence on Company A to evaluate whether such Apax fund
would be interested in potentially pursuing a strategic transaction involving the Company with PE Firm A and
Company A.
Later on December 16, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting with all members of the Special Committee and
representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss in attendance. During the meeting, the Special
Committee nominated and elected Mr. Nicoll as the Chair of the Special Committee. The Special Committee discussed
with representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss Apax’s continued request to permit an Apax
fund to continue discussions with PE Firm A and Company A, including to conduct due diligence on Company A,
with a view towards evaluating whether such Apax fund would be interested in potentially pursuing a strategic
transaction involving the Company with PE Firm A and Company A. The Special Committee considered, among other
things, the interest of the Company’s stockholders in potential counterparties having a meaningful opportunity to
submit a competitive proposal for a transaction, including by having time to conduct due diligence and gain a
familiarity with the Company’s business; that Apax, and if working with an Apax fund, potentially PE Firm A and
Company A, had a much greater familiarity with the Company’s business than many other potential counterparties,
given Apax’s history with the Company; the
37
TABLE OF CONTENTS
restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders of Section 203, which could apply to any
potential counterparty bidding jointly with an Apax fund, unless the Board granted the counterparty a waiver in
advance; and the benefits to the Company and its shareholders of the Special Committee’s process remaining
confidential at that time. After consideration and deliberation, the Special Committee determined that it would
continue to request that Apax refrain from having discussions with PE Firm A and Company A regarding a potential
transaction, including by pausing its due diligence discussions with Company A.
During this meeting, J.P. Morgan representatives updated the Special Committee on the outreaches to potential
counterparties, noting that, at the direction of the Special Committee and the Board, respectively, representatives of
Evercore and of J.P. Morgan had contacted 21 financial and strategic parties. The Special Committee decided to
further explore the indications of interest that the Company had received to date and commence preparation of an
electronic data room (the “Data Room”) to facilitate potential counterparties’ due diligence on the Company. The
Special Committee directed representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan to contact one additional financial party
and four additional strategic parties to assess their interest in participating in a process for a potential strategic
transaction with the Company. The Special Committee further determined that it would invite certain potential
counterparties, including those who had submitted preliminary indications of interest with an offer price of at least
$16.00 per share (or an offer price range that included prices above $16.00 per share) of Duck Creek Common Stock, to
negotiate confidentiality agreements with the Company and receive access to the Data Room, and directed
representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan to encourage the other parties who had submitted indications of
interest to increase their offer prices.
Between December 16, 2022 and December 29, 2022, the Special Committee, with the assistance of its advisors
negotiated, and the Company executed, six confidentiality agreements with potential counterparties, including with (i)
Vista, (ii) PE Firm A and Company A, (iii) PE Firm E, (iv) another private equity firm (“PE Firm J”), (v) two additional
private equity firms and their shared portfolio company (which we refer to collectively as “PE Firm K”) and (vi)
another private equity firm (“PE Firm L”), and each of these parties and their representatives were granted access to
non-public information of the Company in the Data Room and were invited to schedule diligence meetings with
Company management. Each confidentiality agreement included customary standstill provisions (which standstills
terminated, in accordance with their terms, upon the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement). During this
period, the Special Committee, with the assistance of its advisors, also negotiated, and the Company executed, a
clean team confidentiality agreement with PE Firm A and Company A providing for special procedures for reviewing
and handling competitively sensitive information of the Company provided to PE Firm A and Company A in their
diligence review. Over the course of the last two weeks of December 2022, through January 8, 2023, each of the
parties executing a confidentiality agreement with the Company was provided access to the documents included in
the Data Room.
On December 17, 2022, representatives of PE Firm A’s legal counsel and Paul, Weiss discussed briefly the
Special Committee’s process for the evaluation of a strategic transaction. PE Firm A’s legal counsel requested that the
Special Committee permit an Apax fund to conduct due diligence on Company A.
On December 19, 2022, Apax’s legal counsel called Paul, Weiss to ask for an update on the process and on the
Special Committee’s consideration of Apax’s request to permit an Apax fund to continue discussions and due
diligence with PE Firm A and Company A. Apax’s legal counsel informed Paul, Weiss that an Apax fund had engaged
a consulting firm with expertise in the Company’s industry to assist with its due diligence review of Company A,
which was the same firm that had recently been engaged by the Company to assist Company management in
developing some of the market-based assumptions in its drafts of the Stand-Alone Projections (“Consultant A”).
Paul, Weiss representatives also relayed that the Special Committee would consider Apax’s requests again.
On December 19, 2022, PE Firm K submitted a non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a strategic
transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary offer price range of $16.00-$17.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock, in cash.
On December 20, 2022, PE Firm L submitted a written, non-binding, preliminary indication of interest for a
strategic transaction involving the Company, with a preliminary offer price range of $16.00-$17.50 per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in cash.
On December 20, 2022, the Special Committee held a meeting with all members of the Special Committee and
representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Skadden in attendance. Prior to
38
TABLE OF CONTENTS
J.P. Morgan representatives joining the meeting, representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee
Evercore’s preliminary financial analyses of the Company. After J.P. Morgan representatives joined the meeting,
Evercore representatives and J.P. Morgan representatives updated the Special Committee on the status of
discussions with potential counterparties and their review of the Company. J.P. Morgan representatives also advised
the Special Committee that representatives of PE Firm A had informed them that PE Firm A did not require Apax as a
partner for its proposal for a strategic transaction with the Company, and that PE Firm A would continue to follow the
Special Committee’s requests with respect to communications with Apax.
During this meeting, Paul, Weiss representatives informed the Special Committee that Apax, through its legal
counsel, notified them that an Apax fund had engaged Consultant A to conduct due diligence on Company A in its
evaluation of whether such Apax fund would be interested in potentially pursuing a strategic transaction involving
the Company with PE Firm A and Company A. The Special Committee considered this and decided to communicate to
Apax the Special Committee’s concerns about Apax continuing to use Consultant A for this work, because
Consultant A had received access to the Company’s confidential information as part of its engagement by the
Company and the Special Committee believed that allowing Apax to continue to use Consultant A could give Apax
an informational advantage over other potential counterparties because Consultant A was unlikely to have sufficient
consultants with relevant industry experience to establish separate, dedicated teams to represent each potential
counterparty to a strategic transaction involving the Company who wished to engage Consultant A to assist in its
diligence of the Company.
During this meeting, representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan advised the Special Committee that earlier that
day, Vista requested permission to share Company confidential information with three potential co-investors, and PE
Firm A requested permission to share Company confidential information with a number of direct lenders. The Special
Committee determined, in light of risks of premature market leaks of the process, to permit the sharing of Company
confidentiality information with potential co-investors but not direct lenders at that time.
Also during this meeting, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors whether to provide the Stand-
Alone Projections to potential counterparties during their due diligence. The Special Committee determined that the
Stand-Alone Projections should be provided to potential counterparties, and the Stand-Alone Projections were
uploaded to the Data Room shortly thereafter.
At this meeting, the Special Committee also discussed that certain potential counterparties had requested the
ability under their confidentiality agreements with the Company to conduct market diligence through the use of third-
party consultants, including in certain cases, Consultant A. On December 22, 2022, in response to these requests, the
Special Committee determined to allow potential counterparties who had executed confidentiality agreements with the
Company to conduct market diligence, but that, in light of Consultant A’s access to confidential information of the
Company and the potential information advantage a party engaging Consultant A may have over parties that cannot
engage Consultant A, the Special Committee would not consent to potential counterparties engaging Consultant A in
connection with their evaluation of a potential transaction. The Special Committee further instructed representatives
of Paul, Weiss and of Skadden to request Consultant A not accept engagements with potential counterparties
relating to an evaluation of a potential transaction involving the Company.
On December 20, 2022, representatives of Apax spoke with representatives of Evercore regarding Apax’s request
to be permitted to have discussions with PE Firm A and Company A.
On December 22, 2022, Apax’s legal counsel and Paul, Weiss representatives again spoke to discuss whether an
Apax fund should be permitted to have access to the Data Room, to conduct due diligence on Company A, and to
have discussions with PE Firm A, and representatives of Paul, Weiss confirmed that the confidentiality agreement PE
Firm A and Company A entered into with the Company prohibited PE Firm A and Company A from having any
discussions or other contact with Apax. Paul, Weiss representatives updated the Special Committee on this
discussion, and on December 23, 2022, the Special Committee authorized Paul, Weiss to begin negotiating a letter
agreement with Apax to authorize Apax to conduct due diligence on Company A, so long as such diligence would
not reasonably be expected to require the Apax fund through which Apax owns Duck Creek Common Stock to file an
amendment to its Schedule 13D for a period of time (the “Apax Letter Agreement”). From the period between
December 23, 2022 and January 7, 2023, representatives of Apax, Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Apax’s legal
counsel communicated from time to time about Apax’s requests to permit an Apax fund to conduct due diligence on
Company A and conduct discussions with PE Firm A and Company A, with a view towards evaluating whether such
Apax fund would be interested in

TABLE OF CONTENTS
potentially pursuing a strategic transaction involving the Company with PE Firm A and Company A. The Special
Committee’s advisors kept the members of the Special Committee apprised of these negotiations, and the Special
Committee discussed and directed the negotiations of the Apax Letter Agreement with its advisors.
On December 22, 2022, Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes met with representatives of PE Firm A and Company A for
a management due diligence meeting. During the period between December 22, 2022 to January 2, 2023, members of
Company management conducted six diligence meetings with potential counterparties and their counsel, covering an
overview of the Company’s business and, to the extent requested and scheduled by the potential counterparties,
additional topics including financial diligence, product and technology diligence, operations diligence and go-to-
market diligence.
On December 27, 2022, Paul, Weiss delivered a draft of the Apax Letter Agreement to Apax’s legal counsel and,
later that day, Apax’s legal counsel sent to Paul, Weiss a revised version reflecting Apax’s comments.
On December 30, 2022, Paul, Weiss representatives informed counsel to Apax that the Special Committee would
review the revised Apax Letter Agreement the week of January 2, 2023.
On January 1, 2023, Vista inquired with J.P. Morgan representatives as to the status of the Special Committee’s
process and asked for guidance on whether the terms of Vista’s preliminary indication of interest were competitive.
J.P. Morgan did not tell Vista where Vista stood relative to other potential counterparties, but in response to Vista’s
question, indicated that the Special Committee would consider offer price and certainty of closing in evaluating a
proposal submitted by Vista relative to proposals submitted by other potential counterparties.
On January 3, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting with all members of the Special Committee and
representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss in attendance. At that meeting, representatives of Evercore
and J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Special Committee the outreach made to date to potential counterparties to a
strategic transaction and the status of discussions with those potential counterparties, including the indications of
interest received, the parties’ progress in conducting due diligence, Vista’s inquiry regarding the competitiveness of
its preliminary indication of interest, and J.P. Morgan’s response to Vista’s inquiry. As of the time of this meeting, 24
potential counterparties had been contacted during the process, including 18 financial parties (including four with
ownership of portfolio companies in the same industry as the Company) and six strategic parties. Of those, 13
potential counterparties had declined to continue with an evaluation of a strategic transaction, five potential
counterparties showed an interest in a potential transaction but were not actively engaged in due diligence with the
Company, and six potential counterparties were actively engaged in due diligence with the Company, all of which
were financial parties (and in some cases, together with their portfolio companies). The Special Committee discussed
with representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss that Vista and PE Firm A had completed the
most diligence of all the potential counterparties to date, and had made more progress on their diligence during the
holiday period than the other potential counterparties. In light of the outstanding management diligence meetings
scheduled with some potential counterparties for the weeks of January 2, 2023 and January 9, 2023, the Special
Committee determined at that time that it would continue to monitor the due diligence progress of the potential
counterparties and would consider, at the beginning of the week of January 9, 2023, the deadline for initial proposals
that it would set.
During the meeting, the Special Committee discussed the process, risks and timing for obtaining necessary
regulatory clearances for a transaction with PE Firm A and Company A, relative to a transaction with the other
potential counterparties then conducting diligence on the Company, including Vista. The Special Committee directed
Paul, Weiss and Skadden to begin working with legal counsel for PE Firm A and Company A on regulatory diligence
and to begin negotiations with legal counsel for PE Firm A and Company A on the terms of a potential merger
agreement relating to regulatory efforts standards and regulatory-related conditions to closing and termination rights.
The Special Committee considered that, because Company A was a participant in the Company’s industry, a
transaction with PE Firm A and Company A could potentially involve more regulatory risk or a longer time to close
than transactions with the other potential counterparties.
On January 4, 2023, Paul, Weiss provided to legal counsel for Apax a further revised version of the Apax Letter
Agreement and Paul, Weiss and legal counsel for Apax continued to negotiate the final terms of the Apax Letter
Agreement during the period up to January 7, 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 5, 2023, the Company announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022.
On January 5, the Company also announced that it had agreed to acquire Imburse. In light of the announcement of
this acquisition, and its projected effects on the Company’s future financial results and long-term value, the Special
Committee discussed the Stand-Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections (as defined in the section entitled
“The Merger-Forecasts” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement) with its advisors and directed the Company’s
management to provide the Imburse Projections to Evercore and J.P. Morgan, and directed Evercore and J.P. Morgan
to utilize both the Stand-Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections, in their updated preliminary financial
analyses of the Company.
On Friday, January 6, 2023, Vista submitted a written, non-binding proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock for $16.50 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash (the “$16.50 Vista Proposal”).
On the same day, and prior to submitting the $16.50 Vista Proposal, representatives of Vista informed representatives
of Evercore and J.P. Morgan that Vista would no longer be interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company if
Vista and the Company did not finalize a definitive agreement and publicly announce a transaction by the morning of
Monday, January 9, 2023.
In connection with submitting the $16.50 Vista Proposal, Vista also submitted a draft merger agreement, voting
agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guarantee to the Special Committee. The $16.50 Vista Proposal stated
that Vista was prepared to deliver fully committed equity financing (providing for a full equity backstop) to fund the
transaction and to proceed with executing definitive agreements, that would grant the Company the right to specific
performance to enforce Vista’s obligations to close; commit Vista to a “hell or high water” standard for its obligations
to obtain regulatory clearances required for closing; and provide the Company a 30-day “go-shop” period after
signing the merger agreement, during which the Company would be permitted to solicit and negotiate competing
proposals for a strategic transaction. The $16.50 Vista Proposal provided for a termination fee payable by the
Company in the event that the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal or in certain
similar circumstances, and such termination fee would be equal to 1.6% of the equity value of the transaction if
termination occurred during the go-shop period, and 3.2% of the equity value of the transaction if termination
occurred after the go-shop period. As part of the $16.50 Vista Proposal, Vista contemplated that certain of the
Company’s large stockholders would execute a voting agreement with Vista to support the Vista transaction.
After receiving the $16.50 Vista Proposal, the Special Committee held a meeting in the early afternoon of January
6, 2023 with all members of the Special Committee and representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss in
attendance. During the meeting, representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan reviewed the financial aspects of the
$16.50 Vista Proposal with the Special Committee and Paul, Weiss representatives reviewed with the Special
Committee the key terms of the $16.50 Vista Proposal and the fiduciary duties of the members of the Special
Committee under Delaware law in considering a potential transaction. The Special Committee discussed with the
representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Paul, Weiss the conditions to completion of the $16.50 Vista
Proposal, including that Vista would not require debt financing or additional equity partners in order to complete a
transaction, and the “high or hell water” regulatory commitment from Vista in the draft merger agreement. The Special
Committee also considered the ability for third parties to submit a superior proposal during the “go-shop” period
proposed by Vista in the draft merger agreement; the broad outreach to a large number of potential counterparties
that had been undertaken by representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan since October 2022, at the direction of
the Special Committee and of the Board, respectively; the likelihood that PE Firm A, PE Firm E, PE Firm J, PE Firm K or
PE Firm L would submit a proposal with a higher offer price or higher closing certainty than the $16.50 Vista Proposal;
the difference between the offer price of $16.50 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock proposed by Vista and the
offer prices that such other parties had indicated to date, equity research analysts’ price targets for the Duck Creek
Common Stock and the value at which the Duck Creek Common Stock was then trading; that PE Firm E, PE Firm J, PE
Firm K and PE Firm L were still in early stages of their diligence review on the Company based on their progress
through the Data Room and the diligence meetings they had or were then scheduled to have with the Company’s
management team; the fact that, like Vista, PE Firm A had completed much more diligence on the Company than the
other potential counterparties during the holiday period, and therefore that PE Firm A was likely to be able to
accelerate its diligence review on the Company and potentially submit a proposal that could be competitive with the
$16.50 Vista Proposal on price and contract terms on the same timeline as Vista; and the fact that Vista and
41
TABLE OF CONTENTS
PE Firm A had each demonstrated a high level of interest in a strategic transaction with the Company and that
allowing them to compete over an abbreviated timeline could provide the Company with enhanced negotiating
leverage in the process and maximize the offer prices proposed by Vista and PE Firm A.
The Special Committee engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the Special Committee’s review of its
strategic alternatives, including whether to inform Apax of, and solicit a proposal for a transaction from Apax and PE
Firm A on, the accelerated timeframe of the $16.50 Vista Proposal and the actions the Special Committee could
consider taking with the other potential counterparties engaged in the process with the Company at that time. After
discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee directed representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan to inform
Vista that the Special Committee would be willing to consider negotiating the terms of the $16.50 Vista Proposal, and
allowing Vista to preempt the broader process that the Special Committee had established, if Vista were willing to
increase its offer price to a materially higher price per share of Duck Creek Common Stock. The Special Committee
further directed representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan to inform PE Firm A, on a no-names basis, that
another potential counterparty submitted a non-binding proposal and had indicated its willingness to negotiate and
execute definitive documentation and announce a transaction by January 9, 2023, that if PE Firm A were still
interested in a transaction involving the Company, PE Firm A must also submit a proposal on that timeline, and that
PE Firm A was competing with a proposal that had full equity financing and a “hell or high water” regulatory
commitment.
At the conclusion of its meeting in the early afternoon of January 6, 2023, the Special Committee further directed
Paul, Weiss to prepare a draft merger agreement to send to legal counsel for PE Firm A and Company A and to
negotiate the draft with them if PE Firm A and Company A indicated they were interested in negotiating and executing
definitive documentation by January 9, 2023. The Special Committee further directed Paul, Weiss and Skadden to
engage with legal counsel for each of Vista and PE Firm A and Company A to conduct regulatory due diligence on a
strategic transaction with each of them over the course of the weekend.
Also on January 6, 2023, representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan, as directed by the Special Committee,
held separate telephone conversations with representatives of PE Firm A and Vista to relay the Special Committee’s
decision. Representatives of PE Firm A informed J.P. Morgan representatives that PE Firm A would assess whether it
would submit a proposal for a transaction, but in the event PE Firm A decided to do so, it would not need a co-bidder
in order to submit a competitive proposal and did not intend to partner with Apax in a proposal for a strategic
transaction involving the Company. PE Firm A requested that the Special Committee propose an initial draft of the
merger agreement. On that call, representatives of PE Firm A also requested guidance on offer price. Representatives
of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan did not give a price target but told PE Firm A that they would need to put their best
foot forward with respect to both price and the regulatory efforts standard in their proposed merger agreement in
order to be competitive.
Later in the day on January 6, 2023, the Special Committee held another meeting at which all members of the
Special Committee, except Ms. Dodd, and representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Skadden were in
attendance. Representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan updated the Special Committee on their discussions with
Vista and PE Firm A. During this meeting, the Special Committee directed Skadden representatives to inform the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer about the $16.50 Vista Proposal and
work with such management members as necessary to assist with the negotiations of the draft definitive agreements
with Vista and PE Firm A and the completion of each counterparty’s confirmatory due diligence review. The Special
Committee also discussed Apax’s request to continue to use Consultant A to conduct due diligence on Company A,
with a separate team walled off from any Consultant A employee advising the Company and so long as Consultant A
did not use or disclose any confidential information of the Company. For the reasons the Special Committee had
discussed and considered in its prior meetings, the Special Committee determined that it would not be appropriate for
an Apax fund to be permitted to continue to use Consultant A to conduct due diligence on Company A at this time
unless a strict information wall were implemented and no employees of Consultant A that did work for the Company
would be on the Consultant A team advising Apax with respect to its due diligence on Company A.
In anticipation of finalizing the Apax Letter Agreement, the Special Committee discussed with its advisors the
potential timing for granting PE Firm A and Company A a waiver under Section 203. The Special Committee
determined to consider and discuss the potential Section 203 waiver once the Apax Letter Agreement was finalized
and ready to be executed.
42
TABLE OF CONTENTS
On the evening of January 6, 2023, PE Firm A submitted a written, non-binding proposal to acquire all
outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock for $16.35 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash (the
“$16.35 PE Firm A Proposal”). PE Firm A’s proposal stated that PE Firm A was prepared to deliver fully committed
equity financing to fund the transaction and requested exclusivity. At the direction of the Special Committee, J.P.
Morgan representatives informed PE Firm A that the offer price in the $16.35 PE Firm A Proposal was not high enough
and asked PE Firm A to increase its offer price in a revised proposal.
On January 7, 2023, at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore provided further
customary relationship disclosures to the Special Committee, which included disclosure of certain relationships
between Evercore and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, PE Firm A, Vista and their respective affiliates
and portfolio companies, as applicable, on the other hand.
Also on January 7, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting at which all members of the Special Committee
and representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Skadden were in attendance. The Special Committee
discussed with the representatives of each of Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Skadden the proposal made by
PE Firm A and directed representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan to continue to solicit a higher offer price from
PE Firm A.
At this meeting, the Special Committee also reviewed with its advisors the terms and conditions of the $16.50
Vista Proposal, including the conditions to closing in the proposed merger agreement, the terms of the go-shop and
no-shop periods included in the proposed merger agreement, the termination fees proposed in the merger agreement
to be payable in the event that the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, among
other events, the remedies available to the Company in the event that closing conditions were satisfied but Vista did
not consummate the closing, and the termination rights available to the Company and Vista under the proposed
merger agreement. The Special Committee also reviewed with its advisors the terms of the draft merger agreement that
Paul, Weiss was preparing to send to PE Firm A and its counsel, including the regulatory covenants included in the
proposed merger agreement. The Special Committee discussed with its advisors the potential for a longer period to
closing a strategic transaction with PE Firm A and Company A, relative to the anticipated period to close a
transaction with Vista, because of potential additional informational requests from regulators relating to the
involvement of a portfolio company in the Company’s industry. The Special Committee, following discussion with its
advisors, determined that the proposed draft of the merger agreement for PE Firm A would be substantially similar to
the proposed merger agreement with Vista, but that the draft agreement for PE Firm A would contain various timing
and other specifically tailored regulatory-related provisions and would provide for a reverse termination fee payable
by PE Firm A in the event of termination of the merger agreement for failure to obtain regulatory clearances.
On January 7, 2023, the Company and Apax finalized and executed the Apax Letter Agreement, reflecting the
terms proposed by the Special Committee at its meeting earlier that day, and Apax received access to the Data Room.
The Apax Letter Agreement, in its final form, permitted Apax to receive access to the Data Room, subject to
confidentiality obligations, engage in co-bidding discussions with PE Firm A and Company A intended to permit the
evaluation as to whether an Apax fund would be interested in potentially pursuing a strategic transaction involving
the Company with PE Firm A and Company A, and conduct diligence on Company A, and provided that Apax would
continue to limit its engagement of Consultant A to its evaluation of Company A, using a team that did not have
confidential information of the Company and who had not worked, and would not work, on Consultant A’s
engagement by the Company. The Apax Letter Agreement also prohibited Apax from taking certain actions that
would reasonably be expected to require the Apax fund through which Apax owns Duck Creek Common Stock to file
a Schedule 13D amendment for a period of time.
Later in the day on January 7, 2023, once the Apax Letter Agreement was confirmed by the parties and their
counsel to be in final form for execution, the Special Committee discussed, and resolved by written consent to grant,
a waiver to PE Firm A under Section 203. The Special Committee further granted a waiver in favor of PE Firm A and
Company A of the prohibitions on co-bidding discussions in their confidentiality agreement with the Company that
would permit PE Firm A and Company A to engage in discussions with Apax regarding a joint proposal for a strategic
transaction involving the Company if they decided they wanted to do so. Following receipt of the Section 203 waiver
and the waiver to permit co-bidding discussions under the confidentiality agreement, PE Firm A’s legal counsel stated
to Paul, Weiss that PE Firm A and Company A did not wish to have discussions with Apax regarding any joint
proposal for a strategic transaction at that time and intended to submit a proposal, without Apax, for negotiation and
execution prior to January 9, 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On January 7, 2023, Paul, Weiss sent a revised draft of the merger agreement and related documents on behalf of
the Special Committee to Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“Kirkland”), Vista’s legal counsel. Later in the day on January 7, 2023,
representatives of Paul, Weiss discussed via telephone with Kirkland the draft merger documents.
On January 7, 2023, Paul, Weiss also sent an initial draft of the merger agreement on behalf of the Special
Committee to legal counsel for PE Firm A and Company A.
Also on January 7, 2023, a representative of Apax reiterated to J.P. Morgan representatives via a telephone call
that Apax was not interested in investing in the buyer group for a strategic transaction involving the Company with
any partner other than potentially PE Firm A and Company A. Separately, that day, as directed by the Special
Committee, Mr. Nicoll informed Mr. Wright via a telephone call that the Special Committee had received proposals
from two potential counterparties for a strategic transaction involving the Company and that the terms of both
proposals were viewed by the Special Committee as attractive. Mr. Nicoll did not disclose the identity of the two
potential counterparties or the terms of the proposals.
On January 7, 2023, the Company executed an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan, providing for J.P. Morgan’s
engagement as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the process for a potential strategic transaction,
and the Company, and the Special Committee, executed an engagement letter with Evercore, providing for Evercore’s
engagement as financial advisor to the Special Committee. J.P. Morgan confirmed in its engagement letter that it had
no conflicts of interest that would prevent J.P. Morgan from acting as a financial advisor to the Company in
connection with a potential strategic transaction.
On January 7, 2023, the Special Committee informed Accenture plc that the Special Committee had received a
proposal from Vista that it was negotiating, with the potential for finalizing and executing transaction documents in
the coming days, and that Vista had requested voting agreements from the Company’s significant stockholders. The
Special Committee requested that Accenture plc negotiate and execute a voting agreement with Vista (or, if the
Special Committee decided to recommend a transaction with PE Firm A rather than Vista, with PE Firm A). Later that
day, Accenture plc’s legal counsel informed representatives of Paul, Weiss that Accenture plc would be willing to
execute a voting agreement with Vista or PE Firm A, if a transaction with either party were approved by the Special
Committee. Throughout the day on January 7 and January 8, 2023, Accenture plc’s legal counsel negotiated and
finalized the terms of a proposed voting agreement with Vista with Kirkland, and during the day on January 8, 2023,
discussed the terms of a proposed voting agreement with PE Firm A with PE Firm A’s legal counsel.
On January 8, 2023, the Imburse Projections were uploaded to the Data Room and made available to potential
counterparties for their due diligence.
On the morning of January 8, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting with representatives of each of Paul,
Weiss, Skadden, Evercore and J.P. Morgan in attendance. The Special Committee discussed the developments since
the last meeting of the Special Committee in negotiations with Vista and PE Firm A, and the significant open points
remaining in negotiations of the terms of the proposals and definitive agreements with each party, relating to offer
price, the terms of the “go-shop” and non-solicit periods and regulatory-related covenants and related provisions.
Representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan updated the Special Committee on the progress and engagement
demonstrated by each of Vista and PE Firm A in completing their due diligence that weekend. The Special Committee
directed its representatives to inform each of Vista and PE Firm A that the deadline for submitting final proposals for a
strategic transaction with the Company would be 7:00 p.m., Eastern Time that day and that the Special Committee
would be reconvening at 8:00 p.m., Eastern Time to consider the final proposals.
The Special Committee invited Ms. Crusco, Mr. Love, Mr. Rajasekar and Mr. Pelzer, the other members of the
Board (other than the Apax nominees and Mr. Jackowski), to join the meeting. The Special Committee informed these
directors of the process followed by the Special Committee and its advisors in the Special Committee’s exploration of
a potential strategic transaction involving the Company, the terms and accelerated timeline of the $16.50 Vista
Proposal, the terms of the $16.35 PE Firm A Proposal, and other recent events in the sales process. The Special
Committee advised these directors that both Vista and PE Firm A were expected to submit revised proposals with
higher offer prices later that day. Skadden representatives reviewed with all of the directors present the fiduciary
duties of directors considering a change in control transaction, and reviewed with them the protocols that the Special
Committee had implemented since its formation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Special Committee then invited Mr. Jackowski and Mr. Rhodes to join the meeting. Representatives of
Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee, the additional directors (including Mr. Jackowski) and Mr. Rhodes the
process undertaken by the Special Committee in evaluating a transaction, including that representatives of Evercore
and of J.P. Morgan had contacted 24 parties, including 18 financial parties (including 4 with ownership of portfolio
companies in the same industry as the Company) and 6 strategic parties, at the direction of the Special Committee and
of the Board, respectively, the terms of the $16.50 Vista Proposal and $16.35 PE Firm A Proposal, and the diligence
review in process by four other potential counterparties.
Representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee, the additional directors (including Mr.
Jackowski) and Mr. Rhodes Evercore’s updated preliminary financial analyses of the Company, based on the
Forecasts at the direction of the Special Committee, and the members of the Special Committee and the additional
directors asked representatives of Evercore various questions about the analyses and discussed Evercore’s
representatives’ answers. Representatives of J.P. Morgan then reviewed its updated preliminary financial analyses of
the Company, based on the Forecasts at the direction of the Board, and the members of the Special Committee and
the additional directors asked representatives of J.P. Morgan various questions about the analyses and discussed J.P.
Morgan’s representatives’ answers. The members of the Special Committee and the additional directors also asked
representatives of each of Evercore and J.P. Morgan questions about the differences between their respective
preliminary financial analyses and the reasons for the differences in assumptions, such as discount rates, applied by
each advisor. The members of the Special Committee and the additional directors also asked representatives of Paul,
Weiss and Skadden questions about the terms of the $16.50 Vista Proposal and the $16.35 PE Firm A Proposal, and
discussed their answers.
Throughout the day on January 8, 2023, representatives of Paul, Weiss and Skadden continued to negotiate the
terms of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documents with Kirkland and legal counsel for PE Firm
A and Company A, and exchanged and discussed various drafts of the documents during the course of the day.
On January 8, 2023, at approximately 8:00 p.m., Eastern Time, the Special Committee held a meeting with all
members of the Special Committee, and representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan, Paul, Weiss and Skadden in
attendance. At the outset of the meeting, representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan advised the Special Committee
that they had not yet received updated proposals for a strategic transaction from either Vista or PE Firm A. The
Special Committee decided to reconvene after updated proposals from Vista and PE Firm A were received.
Later on January 8, 2023, after reconvening the meeting of the Special Committee, the Special Committee was
informed that PE Firm A had submitted a revised written non-binding proposal, including an offer price of $18.15 per
share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash, and shortly thereafter, PE Firm A submitted a further updated, best and
final offer price of $18.66 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash (such proposal, reflecting the updated
price, the “$18.66 PE Firm A Proposal”). The $18.66 PE Firm A Proposal stated that PE Firm A was prepared to deliver
fully committed equity financing to fund the purchase price of the transaction; included a reverse termination fee of
6% of the equity value of the transaction in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in connection with the
failure to obtain regulatory clearances prior to the outside date and a commitment from PE Firm A in the merger
agreement to take all actions and agree to all remedies (except as would have a material adverse effect on the
combined company) in order to obtain regulatory clearances; and required that certain parties who had recently been
engaged in negotiations with the Company would be excluded from the go-shop period contemplated by the merger
agreement. The $18.66 PE Firm A Proposal provided for a termination fee payable by the Company in the event that
the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal or in certain similar circumstances, and
such termination fee would be equal to 1.5% of the equity value of the transaction if termination occurred during the
“go-shop” period, and 2.75% of the equity value of the transaction if termination occurred after the “go-shop”
period. Shortly after submitting the $18.66 PE Firm A Proposal, PE Firm A’s legal counsel sent Paul, Weiss revised
drafts of the merger agreement and other transaction documents.
Also on January 8, 2023, while the meeting of the Special Committee was in process, Vista submitted a revised
written non-binding proposal, including an offer price of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, in cash
(referred to as the “$19.00 Vista Proposal”). The $19.00 Vista Proposal was conditioned on the definitive agreements
being executed within the following two hours and the execution by certain large stockholders of the Company of
voting agreements in support of the transaction; stated that Vista was prepared to deliver fully committed equity
financing to fund the purchase price of the transaction; included a “hell or high water” regulatory efforts covenant;
required that certain parties be excluded from the “go-shop” period
45
TABLE OF CONTENTS
contemplated by the merger agreement; and provided for a termination fee payable by the Company of 1.5% of the
equity value of the transaction relating to a superior proposal during the “go-shop” period, and 3% of the equity
value of the transaction for a termination relating to a superior proposal after the “go-shop” period. Concurrently
with submitting the $19.00 Vista Proposal, Vista also sent the Special Committee revised drafts of the merger
agreement and other transaction documents.
The Special Committee then discussed the $19.00 Vista Proposal and the $18.66 PE Firm A Proposal, including
the changes agreed in the draft merger agreements with Vista and PE Firm A over the course of the day, the fact that
neither counterparty would require debt financing or additional equity partners to complete a transaction, the
differences in the regulatory related terms of each draft merger agreement and the regulatory-related risk profiles of
the two parties in terms of certainty and timing of closing, and that both parties required certain parties to be
excluded from the “go-shop” period (and subject instead to all provisions of the non-solicitation covenants
beginning on the date of the Merger Agreement). The Special Committee compared the offer prices and certainty of
closing in each proposal, and discussed Vista’s request that certain large stockholders of the Company execute
voting agreements with Vista.
Following separate negotiations among the representatives of the legal and financial advisors for the Special
Committee with the legal advisors and other representatives of Vista, and discussions of those negotiations and the
items at issue with the Special Committee during the course of the ongoing meeting of the Special Committee, the
Special Committee and Vista reached agreement on the final terms of the draft merger agreement, including that the
merger agreement would not be conditioned on receipt of voting agreements from particular stockholders, but that
the Company would use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into voting agreements with each holder of 10% or
more of the Duck Creek Common Stock after signing, and that the parties that would be excluded from the “go-shop”
period (and subject instead to all provisions of the non-solicitation covenants beginning on the date of the Merger
Agreement) would consist of holders of 10% or more of the Company’s common stock and any party that had
submitted an acquisition proposal to the Company in the previous five days. In deciding to agree to those provisions
in particular, the Special Committee considered the fact that Apax had clearly stated on multiple occasions that Apax
was not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction involving the Company with any partner other than PE Firm A
and Company A, that PE Firm A had clearly stated on multiple occasions that it did not require a partner, including
Apax, to pursue a strategic transaction involving the Company, and had subsequently stated on January 6, 2023 that
it did not intend to pursue a strategic transaction involving the Company with Apax and the Special Committee’s
belief that PE Firm A’s offer of $18.66 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock was “best and final”. The Special
Committee further considered the fact that Accenture plc had previously informed the Special Committee that it had
no interest in participating as a buyer or co-investor with a potential counterparty in a strategic transaction involving
the Company, had indicated its willingness to enter into a voting agreement with the counterparty to a transaction
recommended by the Special Committee, and that Accenture plc had negotiated and finalized the terms of a voting
agreement with Vista.
During the meeting, representatives of Evercore reviewed with the Special Committee its financial analyses of
the Company and the $19.00 Vista Proposal. The financial analyses presented by Evercore were, at the direction of
the Special Committee, based on the Forecasts. Evercore delivered to the Special Committee its oral opinion, which
was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 8, 2023, and that is attached to this Proxy
Statement as Annex B-2, that as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per
share to be received by the holders of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders.
After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee unanimously (i) determined that it was in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders to enter into the Merger Agreement with Vista in accordance with the
terms of the $19.00 Vista Proposal and the additional terms agreed by the Special Committee and Vista, (ii)
recommended that the Board approve, declare advisable and enter into the Merger Agreement and approve the
execution, delivery and consummation of the merger and other transactions in accordance with the Merger
Agreement and the DGCL and (iii) recommended that, subject to the approval by the Board of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the approval of the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Immediately following the meeting of the Special Committee on January 8, 2023, the Board held a meeting with all
members of the Board (other than Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie) and with representatives of Evercore, J.P. Morgan,
Paul, Weiss and Skadden in attendance. The Special Committee delivered its recommendation to the Board that the
Board approve, declare advisable and enter into the Merger Agreement and approve the execution, delivery and
consummation of the merger and other transactions in accordance with the Merger Agreement and the DGCL.
Representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan updated the directors on their respective financial analyses of the
Company, which had been presented to the directors at the Special Committee meeting earlier that day, to take into
account the $19.00 Vista Proposal. J.P. Morgan rendered to the Board its oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 9, 2023, and that is attached to this Proxy Statement as
Annex B-1, that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, and matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion,
the Merger Consideration to be paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement with
Vista was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After discussion and deliberation and based in part on
the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board (i) determined that it is in the best interests of
Duck Creek and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it advisable and approved
and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company,
the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Accenture Voting
Agreement, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Following the meeting of the Board, representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan notified Vista that the Special
Committee and the Board had adopted resolutions approving the Merger Agreement.
Shortly thereafter, the Company and Vista finalized and executed the Merger Agreement and other merger
documentation, and Accenture plc executed a voting agreement with Vista in favor of the transactions.
At the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement, Vista had not discussed the terms of any post-closing
employment or equity participation for the Company’s management with the Special Committee, the Company or any
members of the Company’s management.
The following morning, on January 9, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the
Merger Agreement.
Because Apax, PE Firm A and Company A were all deemed to be Excluded Parties under the Merger Agreement,
during the week of January 9, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company terminated the
Data Room access of each of Apax, PE Firm A and Company A, and requested that each of them and their
representatives return or destroy the confidential information of the Company that they had received during the
course of their evaluation of a potential transaction.
On January 11, 2023, the Special Committee held a meeting with all members of the Special Committee and Paul,
Weiss representatives in attendance. The Special Committee discussed the Company’s obligation under the Merger
Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into voting agreements with each holder of 10% or more of
the Duck Creek Common Stock after signing. Accordingly, the Special Committee directed its advisors to request that
Apax execute a voting agreement. Later that day, Paul, Weiss representatives informed Apax’s legal counsel of the
Special Committee’s request. Between January 11, 2023 and February 17, 2023, Apax, Apax’s legal counsel, the
Company, Paul, Weiss, Vista and Vista’s legal counsel discussed from time to time Apax’s willingness to enter into the
voting agreement. The Apax Voting Agreement was entered into on February 17, 2023.
During the Go-Shop Period, at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and of J.P.
Morgan contacted the potential counterparties who had been conducting diligence prior to the announcement of the
Merger Agreement (other than Apax, PE Firm A and Company A) regarding their interest in pursuing an Acquisition
Proposal. Each of these parties indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction involving the
Company at that time. At the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Evercore and of J.P. Morgan also
contacted nine additional potential counterparties, including eight financial parties and one
47
TABLE OF CONTENTS
strategic party. Of these parties, one financial party (“PE Firm M”), requested to negotiate a confidentiality agreement
with the Company; however, after negotiations, PE Firm M did not enter into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company and declined to continue with an evaluation of a strategic transaction.
The Go-Shop Period expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on February 7, 2023."""

The Special Committee
On January 8, 2023, the Special Committee, after considering various factors, including those described herein,
and after consultation with the Special Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, (ii) approved and adopted the Merger
Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Board approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Special Committee
consulted with the Company’s senior management, and the legal and financial advisors of the Company and the
Special Committee. In reaching its determinations and recommendations, the Special Committee considered a number
of factors, including the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance) which the Special
Committee viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its determination and recommendation:
•
Premium to Market Price. The fact that the Merger Consideration of $19.00 for each share of Duck Creek
Common Stock represents a premium of approximately (i) 46% relative to the unaffected closing price of
Duck Creek Common Stock on January 6, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the
Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement) and (ii) 64% relative to the volume weighted average price of
Duck Creek Common Stock for the 30 days ending January 6, 2023. Certain historical market prices of the
Duck Creek Common Stock are set forth in the table in the section entitled “Market Prices” beginning on
page 103 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Opinion of Evercore. The opinion of Evercore, dated January 8, 2023, to the Special Committee to the effect
that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share to be received by
the holders of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Duck Creek’s
Financial Advisors.”
•
Financial Analyses. The financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee and the
Board by representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan.
•
History of Negotiations. The fact that the Special Committee negotiated vigorously with Vista with respect
to price and other terms of the Merger Agreement, including obtaining a price increase by Vista from Vista’s
initial offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock to $19.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock, which after consultation with Evercore and J.P. Morgan, the Special Committee believed
represented the highest price that Vista was willing to pay.
•
Other Strategic Alternatives. The Special Committee’s assessment that the Merger Consideration of $19.00
per share of Duck Creek Common Stock is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the
potential value that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives
reasonably available, including a sale to another potential counterparty, the continuation of the Company’s
business plan as an independent public company or potential expansion opportunities through
acquisitions and combinations of the Company with other businesses.
•
Form of Consideration. The fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, and therefore would provide the
Company’s stockholders significant, immediate and certain value and liquidity for their shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock, taking into account the effect on Company stockholders of long-term business and
execution risk, as well as risks related to the financial markets generally.
•
Solicitation Process Prior to Merger Agreement. The Special Committee’s fulsome process, together with
its and the Company’s advisors, for soliciting and responding to offers from potential counterparties that
were believed to be the most willing and able to pay for the highest price for the
48
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Duck Creek Common Stock, including the fact that 24 parties were contacted or solicited during the Special
Committee’s process for exploring a potential strategic transaction in an effort to obtain the best value
reasonably available to stockholders, seven of which entered into confidentiality agreements with the
Company and were provided with an opportunity to conduct due diligence, including conducting
management diligence sessions with members of the Company’s management (as described under the
section entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger” beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement), in
addition to nine parties who were later contacted during the Go-Shop Period.
•
Loss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Special Committee declined to recommend the Merger
Agreement, there may not be another opportunity for the Company’s stockholders to receive a comparably
priced offer with a comparable level of closing certainty. The Special Committee also considered Vista’s
position that Vista would no longer be interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company if the parties
did not finalize a definitive agreement and publicly announce a transaction by the morning of January 9,
2023 and that Vista had been one of the two most engaged potential counterparties to a transaction to date.
•
Current Conditions. The current state of the U.S. and global economies, including increased volatility in
the credit, financial and stock markets, global inflation trends and the increasing interest rate environment
to combat inflation, the potential for a recession, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the Company’s industry and the
trading price of the Duck Creek Common Stock.
•
Likelihood of Closing. The likelihood that the Merger would be completed, based on, among other things
(not in any relative order of importance):
○
the fact that Parent and Merger Sub obtained committed equity financing for the transactions, and the
limited number and nature of the conditions to the equity financing;
○
the absence of a financing condition of any kind in the Merger Agreement;
○
the likelihood and anticipated timing of obtaining all required regulatory approvals in connection with
the Merger;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the equity
commitment letter, to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity
commitments to Parent to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment letter;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek
specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and enforce specifically the terms
of the Merger Agreement; and
○
Vista’s ability to complete large acquisition transactions.
•
Accenture Voting Agreement. The fact that the Accenture Signatories, who hold approximately 15.9% of the
voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, had informed the Special Committee that they were willing
to, and at the time the Company executed the Merger Agreement did, enter into a voting agreement,
pursuant to which they agreed to vote their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in favor of the adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreement.
•
Merger Agreement Terms. The terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, which were
reviewed by the Special Committee with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and the fact that
such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties, including:
○
the Company’s ability during the Go-Shop Period to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from, and
participate in discussions and negotiations with, third parties;
○
the Company’s ability to consider and respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals, including to
furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties under certain circumstances
specified in the Merger Agreement;
49
TABLE OF CONTENTS
○
the Board’s ability, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to
enter into an agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company complies with
its obligations relating to Superior Proposals under the Merger Agreement and concurrently pays to
Parent the Company Termination Fee, as described in “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Termination of
the Merger Agreement” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement-Company Termination Fee”;
○
Vista’s commitment to a “hell or high water” standard for its obligations to obtain
regulatory clearances required for closing; and
○
the fact that Vista Fund VIII provided a limited guarantee in favor of the Company, which guarantees
certain obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement.
•
Appraisal Rights. The fact that Company stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement
have the right to demand appraisal of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in accordance with the
procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL.
In the course of its deliberations, the Special Committee also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and
other countervailing factors relating to entering into the Merger Agreement, including (not necessarily in order of
relative importance):
•
Closing Certainty. The risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all.
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth. The fact that, following the Merger, the Company
stockholders would no longer participate in the Company’s future earnings or growth, or benefit from any
future appreciation in value of the Duck Creek Common Stock.
•
Impact of Merger Announcement on the Company. The risk that disruptions from the Merger (including the
ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a change of control) will harm (i) the
Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the pendency of the Merger,
and (ii) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel. The potential adverse reactions or
changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger and
potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency
of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance.
•
Loss of Opportunity with other Potential Counterparties. The possibility that another potential
counterparty could have submitted an acquisition proposal with a higher offer price than the Merger
Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock if the Company did not enter into the
Merger Agreement and continued the process for a strategic transaction with other potential
counterparties.
•
Tax Treatment. The fact that the receipt of the Merger Consideration, which is all cash, in exchange for
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement would be taxable to the
Company’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Restrictions on Solicitation. The restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s
solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals from third parties during and after the Go-Shop Period, and
that prospective bidders may perceive Vista’s right under the Merger Agreement to negotiate with the
Company to match the terms of any Superior Proposal prior to the Company being able to terminate the
Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to making alternative acquisition
proposals.
•
Excluded Parties During Go-Shop Period. The fact that Excluded Parties are excluded from the Go-Shop
Period, with the effect that such parties would not have the benefit of a lower termination fee payable by
the Company, if they were interested in submitting an Acquisition Proposal during the Go-Shop Period, and
would be required, during the Go-Shop Period, to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Merger
Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date.
50
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Termination Fee. The possibility that the termination fee payable by the Company under certain
circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
and enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with any person (other than an Excluded Party),
could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing proposal to acquire the Company
(which termination fee would be equal to $39,168,671 if the Merger Agreement is terminated during the Go-
Shop Period, and $78,337,343 if the Merger Agreement is terminated after the Go-Shop Period, or with
respect to an Excluded Party, during or after the Go-Shop Period).
•
Cap on Vista Liability. That the Merger Agreement provides that the maximum aggregate liability of Vista
for breaches under the Merger Agreement, guarantee or the equity commitment letter will not exceed, in the
aggregate for all such breaches, the Parent Liability Limitation.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the
completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which could delay or prevent the
Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise
take with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
The Special Committee concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the
Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits.
In addition, the Special Committee was aware of and considered the fact that some of our directors and executive
officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, Company stockholders generally,
including those interests that are a result of employment and compensation arrangements with the Company. For
more information, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck
Creek in the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Special Committee in reaching its conclusions and
recommendation includes the principal factors considered by the Special Committee, but is not intended to be
exhaustive and may not include all of the factors considered by the Special Committee. In light of the variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Special Committee
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. Rather, the Special Committee based its
decisions on the totality of the factors and information it considered. Moreover, each member of the Special
Committee applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to
different factors.
The Duck Creek Board
On January 8, 2023, the Board, after considering various factors, including those described herein, and after
consultation with Duck Creek’s independent legal and financial advisors, (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) declared it advisable and
approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, approved the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations thereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the terms and
conditions set forth therein and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.
The Board recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, thereby
approving the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) “FOR” the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may be payable by Duck Creek to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Board consulted with the
Company’s senior management, and the legal and financial advisors of the Company. In reaching its determinations
and recommendations, the Board considered a number of factors, including the following factors (not necessarily in
order of relative importance) which the Board viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its
determination and recommendation:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
Premium to Market Price. The fact that the Merger Consideration of $19.00 for each share of Duck Creek
Common Stock represents a premium of approximately (i) 46% relative to the unaffected closing price of
Duck Creek Common Stock on January 6, 2023 (the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the
Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement) and (ii) 64% relative to the volume weighted average price of
Duck Creek Common Stock for the 30 days ending January 6, 2023. Certain historical market prices of the
Duck Creek Common Stock are set forth in the table in the section entitled “Market Prices” beginning on
page 103 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Opinion of Evercore. The opinion of Evercore, dated January 8, 2023, to the Special Committee to the effect
that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share to be received by
the holders of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Duck Creek’s
Financial Advisors” beginning on page 55 of this Proxy Statement.
•
Opinion of J.P. Morgan. The January 8, 2023 oral opinion delivered by J.P. Morgan to the Board, which was
confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated January 9, 2023, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered,
and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be
paid to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as more fully described below in the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Duck Creek’s
Financial Advisors” beginning on page 55 of this Proxy Statement. The full text of the written opinion of
J.P. Morgan, dated January 9, 2023, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B-1 to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by
reference.
•
Financial Analyses. The financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee and the
Board by representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan.
•
History of Negotiations. The fact that the Special Committee negotiated vigorously with Vista with respect
to price and other terms of the Merger Agreement, including obtaining a price increase by Vista from Vista’s
initial offer price of $15.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock to $19.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock, which after consultation with Evercore and J.P. Morgan, the Special Committee believed
represented the highest price that Vista was willing to pay.
•
Unanimous Recommendation by the Special Committee. The fact that the Special Committee unanimously
recommended that the Board approve, declare advisable and enter into the Merger Agreement and approve
the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in
accordance with the Merger Agreement and the DGCL.
•
Other Strategic Alternatives. The Board’s assessment that the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of
Duck Creek Common Stock is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the potential value
that would reasonably be expected to result from other strategic and financial alternatives reasonably
available, including a sale to another potential counterparty, the continuation of the Company’s business
plan as an independent public company or potential expansion opportunities through acquisitions and
combinations of the Company with other businesses.
•
Form of Consideration. The fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, and therefore would provide the
Company’s stockholders significant, immediate and certain value and liquidity for their shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock, taking into account the effect on Company stockholders of long-term business and
execution risk, as well as risks related to the financial markets generally.
•
Solicitation Process Prior to Merger Agreement. The Special Committee’s fulsome process, together with
its and the Company’s advisors, for soliciting and responding to offers from potential counterparties that
were believed to be the most willing and able to pay for the highest price for the Duck Creek Common
Stock, including the fact that 24 parties were contacted or solicited during the Special Committee’s process
for exploring a potential strategic transaction in an effort to obtain the best
 
52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
value reasonably available to stockholders, seven of which entered into confidentiality agreements with
the Company and were provided with an opportunity to conduct due diligence, including conducting
management diligence sessions with members of the Company’s management (as described under the
section entitled “The Merger-Background of the Merger” beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement), in
addition to nine parties who were later contacted during the Go-Shop Period.
•
Loss of Opportunity. The possibility that, if the Board declined to approve the Merger Agreement, there
may not be another opportunity for the Company’s stockholders to receive a comparably priced offer with a
comparable level of closing certainty. The Board also considered Vista’s position that Vista would no longer
be interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company if the parties did not finalize a definitive
agreement and publicly announce a transaction by the morning of January 9, 2023 and that Vista had been
one of the two most engaged potential counterparties to a transaction to date.
•
Current Conditions. The current state of the U.S. and global economies, including increased volatility in
the credit, financial and stock markets, global inflation trends and the increasing interest rate environment
to combat inflation, the potential for a recession, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
the current and potential impact in both the near term and long term on the Company’s industry and the
trading price of the Duck Creek Common Stock.
•
Likelihood of Closing. The likelihood that the Merger would be completed, based on, among other things
(not in any relative order of importance):
○
the fact that Parent and Merger Sub obtained committed equity financing for the transactions, and the
limited number and nature of the conditions to the equity financing;
○
the absence of a financing condition of any kind in the Merger Agreement;
○
the likelihood and anticipated timing of obtaining all required regulatory approvals in connection with
the Merger;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the equity
commitment letter, to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the equity
commitments to Parent to be funded pursuant to the equity commitment letter;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to seek
specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and enforce specifically the terms
of the Merger Agreement; and
○
Vista’s ability to complete large acquisition transactions.
•
Accenture Voting Agreement. The fact that the Accenture Signatories, who hold approximately 15.9% of the
voting power of the Duck Creek Common Stock, had informed the Special Committee that they were willing
to, and at the time the Company executed the Merger Agreement did, enter into a voting agreement,
pursuant to which they agreed to vote their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in favor of the adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions of the voting agreement.
•
Merger Agreement Terms. The terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, which were
reviewed by the Board with its and the Special Committee’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and
the fact that such terms were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between the parties, including:
○
the Company’s ability during the Go-Shop Period to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from, and
participate in discussions and negotiations with, third parties;
○
the Company’s ability to consider and respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals, including to
furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties under certain circumstances
specified in the Merger Agreement;
○
the Board’s ability, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change;
○
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to
enter into an agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company complies
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
with its obligations relating to Superior Proposals under the Merger Agreement and concurrently pays
to Parent the Company Termination Fee, as described in the sections entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement-Termination of the Merger Agreement” beginning on page 99 of this Proxy Statement and
“Terms of the Merger Agreement-Company Termination Fee” beginning on page 100 of this Proxy
Statement;
○
Vista’s commitment to a “hell or high water” standard for its obligations to obtain
regulatory clearances required for closing; and
○
the fact that Vista Fund VIII provided a limited guarantee in favor of the Company, which guarantees
certain obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement.
•
Appraisal Rights. The fact that Company stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement
have the right to demand appraisal of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in accordance with the
procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL.
In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other
countervailing factors relating to entering into the Merger Agreement, including (not necessarily in order of relative
importance):
•
Closing Certainty. The risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all.
•
No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth. The fact that, following the Merger, the Company
stockholders would no longer participate in the Company’s future earnings or growth, or benefit from any
future appreciation in value of the Duck Creek Common Stock.
•
Impact of Merger Announcement on the Company. The risk that disruptions from the Merger (including the
ability of certain customers to terminate or amend contracts upon a change of control) will harm (i) the
Company’s business, including current plans and operations, including during the pendency of the Merger,
and (ii) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel. The potential adverse reactions or
changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger and
potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency
of the Merger that could affect the Company’s financial performance.
•
Loss of Opportunity with other Potential Counterparties. The possibility that another potential
counterparty could have submitted an acquisition proposal with a higher offer price than the Merger
Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock if the Company did not enter into the
Merger Agreement and continued the process for a strategic transaction with other potential
counterparties.
•
Tax Treatment. The fact that the receipt of the Merger Consideration, which is all cash, in exchange for
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement would be taxable to the
Company’s stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•
Restrictions on Solicitation. The restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s
solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals from third parties during and after the Go-Shop Period, and
that prospective bidders may perceive Vista’s right under the Merger Agreement to negotiate with the
Company to match the terms of any Superior Proposal prior to the Company being able to terminate the
Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to making alternative acquisition
proposals.
•
Excluded Parties During Go-Shop Period. The fact that Excluded Parties are excluded from the Go-Shop
Period, with the effect that such parties would not have the benefit of a lower termination fee payable by
the Company, if they were interested in submitting an Acquisition Proposal during the Go-Shop Period, and
would be required, during the Go-Shop Period, to comply with the restrictions imposed by the Merger
Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date.
•
Termination Fee. The possibility that the termination fee payable by the Company under certain
circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
and enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with any person (other than an Excluded
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Party), could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing proposal to acquire the
Company (which termination fee would be equal to $39,168,671 if the Merger Agreement is terminated
during the Go-Shop Period, and $78,337,343 if the Merger Agreement is terminated after the Go-Shop
Period, or with respect to an Excluded Party, during or after the Go-Shop Period).
•
Cap on Vista Liability. That the Merger Agreement provides that the maximum aggregate liability of Vista
for breaches under the Merger Agreement, guarantee or the equity commitment letter will not exceed, in the
aggregate for all such breaches, the Parent Liability Limitation.
•
Pre-Closing Covenants. The restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the
completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which could delay or prevent the
Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise
take with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
The Board concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were
outweighed by the potential benefits.
In addition, the Board was aware of and considered the fact that some of the Company’s directors and executive
officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the Company stockholders generally,
including those interests that are a result of employment and compensation arrangements with the Company. For
more information, see the section entitled “The Merger-Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck
Creek in the Merger” beginning on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendation
includes the principal factors considered by the Board, but is not intended to be exhaustive and may not include all
of the factors considered by the Board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation
of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative or specific weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and
recommendations. Rather, the Board based its decisions on the totality of the factors and information it considered.
Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may
have given different weight to different factors."""

which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated as of January 9, 2023, that as of the date of
such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, and matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid
to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated January 9, 2023, which sets forth, among other things,
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P.
Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex B-1 to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by
reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes
of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration to be paid to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in the proposed Merger and did not express
any opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by
the Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness
opinion committee of J.P. Morgan. The summary of the
55
TABLE OF CONTENTS
opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such
opinion, which is attached as Annex B-1 to this Proxy Statement. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation
to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or
any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed a draft dated January 8, 2023 of the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the
industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain
transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information
concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical
market prices of Duck Creek Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company
relating to its business, as discussed more fully in the section entitled “The Merger-Forecasts” beginning
on page 68 of this Proxy Statement; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan
deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect
to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed
necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information
that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed
by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness,
and, pursuant to J.P. Morgan’s engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to
undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation
or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or Parent under
any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by the Company’s
management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such
analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on
which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger
Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger
Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P.
Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that
subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the consideration to be paid to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan
has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Merger
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the
underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with
respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the
Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the holders of Duck Creek Common
Stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the holders of Duck Creek
Common Stock, were determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the
decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Special Committee and the Board. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the
proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Special Committee, the Board or the
Company’s management with respect to the proposed Merger or the consideration, including the consideration to be
paid to the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation
methodologies in rendering its opinion to the Board on January 8, 2023, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion, dated as of January 9, 2023, and in the financial analyses presented to the Board on
January 8, 2023 in connection with the rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial
analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion to the Board and does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to
more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text
of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of
the Company with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that J.P. Morgan judged
to be sufficiently analogous to the Company based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and its familiarity with the industries
in which the Company operates. The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
Insurance Vertical Software
•
Guidewire Software, Inc.
•
Verisk Analytics, Inc.
•
CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc.
•
Sapiens International Corporation N.V.
Financial Services Vertical Software
•
Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc.
•
Model N, Inc.
•
nCino, Inc.
•
Q2 Holdings, Inc.
These companies selected were chosen by J.P. Morgan because they are publicly traded companies with
operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, were considered similar to the Company.
However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company.
The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies
differently than they would affect the Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the multiple of the firm
value (the “FV”) (calculated as equity value, plus or minus, as applicable, net debt or net cash) to the analyst
consensus estimates of calendar year 2023 revenues for the applicable company (the “FV/2023E Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/2023E Net Revenue Multiple reference range for
the Company of 4.0x to 6.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for
57
TABLE OF CONTENTS
calendar year 2023 as set forth in the Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for
Duck Creek Common Stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of approximately $12.30 to $18.80, which J.P. Morgan
compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Selected Transactions Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected
transactions involving businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company’s business
(or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and familiarity with the industries in which the Company
operates. The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as relevant to the evaluation of the proposed
Merger:

None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the selected
transactions were chosen by J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan judged certain aspects of the transactions, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, to be similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the multiple of the
target company’s FV implied in the relevant transaction to the target company’s estimated revenue for the twelve
months immediately following the announcement of the applicable transaction (the “FV/NTM Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the
Company of 4.0x to 8.5x. J.P. Morgan then applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for
calendar year 2023 as set forth in the Forecasts. The analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value for
Duck Creek Common Stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of approximately $12.30 to $24.00, which J.P. Morgan
compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of
determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share for Duck Creek Common Stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the
unlevered free cash flow that the Company is expected to generate from December 1, 2022 through fiscal year 2032
based upon the Forecasts, which were discussed with, and approved by, the Company for use by J.P. Morgan in
connection with its financial analyses. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the
end of this period by applying perpetual growth rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.5%, which range was selected in
consultation with Company management, to estimates of terminal revenue for the Company at the end of fiscal year
2032, based on the Forecasts. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of
terminal values to present value as of November 30, 2022 using discount rates ranging from 9.25% to 10.25%, which
range was chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company.
The present values of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of terminal values were then adjusted for
the Company’s estimated net debt, calculated pro forma for the Company’s expected acquisition of Imburse, of $244
million as of November 30, 2022, as provided by management of the Company. This analysis indicated a range of
implied per share equity value for Duck Creek Common Stock (rounded to the nearest $0.10) of $14.60 to $20.10, which
J.P. Morgan compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the
foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of
the
58
TABLE OF CONTENTS
processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical
purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the Company. The
order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P.
Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors
considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative),
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the
factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous
factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or
made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the
selected companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the
selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. However, the companies selected were chosen
by J.P. Morgan because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P.
Morgan’s analysis, were considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen
by J.P. Morgan because J.P. Morgan judged certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s
analysis, to be similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other
factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the proposed
Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive
and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with
respect to the proposed Merger and deliver an opinion to the Board with respect to the proposed Merger on the
basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters
and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P.
Morgan an estimated fee of approximately $21 million, $1.5 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time

Opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C.
The Special Committee retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives including, but not limited to, a merger or sale of all or a
majority of the equity, business or assets of the Company, regardless of the form or structure thereof, or other
significant corporate transaction. As part of this engagement, the Special Committee requested that Evercore
evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
Duck Creek Common Stock. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on January 8, 2023, Evercore rendered to the
Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per
share to be received by the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated January 8, 2023, which sets forth, among other things,
the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B-2 to this Proxy Statement and is incorporated
herein by reference. The Company encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s
opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore’s opinion does not address the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the
Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.
In connection with rendering its opinion Evercore, among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
Evercore deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
•
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company, including certain net operating
loss carryforwards of the Company, prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of the Company,
as approved for its use by the Special Committee and the Company, as more fully described in the section
entitled “The Merger-Forecasts” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement;
•
discussed with management of the Company and the Special Committee their assessment of the past and
current operations of the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the Company, and the
Forecasts (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-Forecasts” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy
Statement);
•
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Duck Creek Common Stock;
60
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of
certain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant;
•
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with
the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed
relevant;
•
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated January 8, 2023, of the Merger Agreement; and
•
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available
to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, without any independent verification of such information (and Evercore
did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and further relied
upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, Evercore assumed with the
Special Committee’s consent that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company and the Special Committee as to the future
financial performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the
financial performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. Evercore expressed no view as to the
Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based.
For purposes of Evercore’s analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that
the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Evercore, that
the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement were true and correct, that each
party would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement
and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger would be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof.
Evercore further assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents,
approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any delay, limitation,
restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or
reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Duck Creek Common Stock of the Merger. As the Special
Committee was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets had been experiencing unusual volatility and Evercore
expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such volatility on the parties or the Merger.
Evercore did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and did not make
or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor was Evercore
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of the
Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion
was necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the date of Evercore’s opinion and financial,
economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date of the opinion. It was
understood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.
Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness to the holders of the Duck Creek Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration.
Evercore did not express any view on, and Evercore’s opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed
transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation
to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons,
whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Evercore was not asked to, nor did Evercore express any
view on, and Evercore’s opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger,
including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or
instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger
Agreement. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or
financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor did it
61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger. Evercore’s opinion did not
constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as
to how any holder of shares of the Duck Creek Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. Evercore
did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will trade at any time, as to
the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Merger or as to the
impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations
when they come due. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax
matters.
Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special Committee
on January 8, 2023 in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be
a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of
these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data that existed on or before January 6, 2023, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial
conditions, industry sector performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of
its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The estimates contained in Evercore's analyses
and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by Evercore's analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of
companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies,
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from,
Evercore's analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In
order to fully understand the analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The
tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of Evercore’s financial
analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of such analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining the fully diluted equity
value per share for Duck Creek Common Stock.
Using discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%, which were based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted
average cost of capital, and the mid-year cash flow discounting convention, Evercore discounted to present value as
of November 30, 2022, (i) estimates of Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs (as defined in the section entitled “The
Merger-Forecasts” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement) that the Company was forecasted to generate
during the second, third and fourth quarters of the Company’s fiscal year 2023 and the Company’s fiscal years 2024
through 2032 based on the Forecasts, and (ii) a range of terminal values for Duck Creek, which was calculated by
applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.0%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s
professional judgment and experience, to estimate the terminal year unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the
Company was forecasted to generate based on the Forecasts, assuming a 22% tax rate in the second, third and fourth
quarters of the Company’s fiscal year 2023 and a 24% tax rate in all fiscal years thereafter, in each case as approved
by the Company’s management. Evercore derived ranges of implied total enterprise values by adding the range of
present values derived above.
In calculating implied total enterprise values, Evercore included the present value of tax savings from the
Company’s estimated usage of NOLs (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger-Forecasts” beginning on page
68 of this Proxy Statement) based on the Forecasts ranging between $19 million and $20 million. Based on this range
of implied enterprise values, adjusted for the Company’s net debt (calculated as total debt less cash and cash
equivalents, each as of November 30, 2022, less the estimated $20 million cash consideration
62
TABLE OF CONTENTS
anticipated by the Company’s management to be paid for the acquisition of Imburse), and divided by the fully diluted
shares outstanding of Duck Creek Common Stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this
analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $10.25 to $17.15
(rounded to the nearest five cents), compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock.
Selected Public Company Trading Analysis
Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial information of the Company to corresponding financial
multiples and ratios for Guidewire Software, Inc., a selected publicly traded company in the P&C insurance industry,
and for the following selected publicly traded companies in the vertical software and financial software industries
(collectively, the “selected companies”), which were selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and
experience:
•
P&C Insurance
•
Guidewire Software, Inc.
•
Vertical Software
•
AppFolio, Inc.

For each of the selected companies, Evercore calculated total enterprise value (defined as equity market
capitalization plus total debt, plus preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents, less
unconsolidated investments) as a multiple of estimated revenue for the 2023 and 2024 calendar years, which is
referred to as “2023E Revenue” and “2024E Revenue”, respectively, in each case, based on closing share prices as of
January 6, 2023. Estimated financial data of the selected companies were based on publicly available research
analysts’ estimates.

Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Evercore applied a total enterprise value / revenue multiple reference range of 3.5-6.5x to the Company’s
2023E Revenue (“TEV / 2023E Revenue Reference Range”) and a total enterprise value / revenue multiple reference
range of 3.0-6.0x to the Company’s 2024E Revenue (“TEV / 2024E Revenue Reference Range”), in each case, based on
the Forecasts. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s net debt (calculated as total debt less
cash and cash equivalents, each as of November 30, 2022, less the estimated $20 million cash consideration
anticipated by the Company’s management to be paid for the acquisition of Imburse), and the number of fully diluted
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis
indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $10.95 to $18.80 (rounded to the
nearest five cents) based on the TEV / 2023E Revenue Reference Range and a range of implied equity values per
share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $10.85 to $19.95 (rounded to the nearest five cents) based on the TEV / 2024E
Revenue Reference Range, in each case, compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock.
Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected these
companies because they are publicly traded P&C insurance, vertical software and financial software companies that
Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of
its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard
to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as
differences in the selected companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation
of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies and the multiples
derived from the selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself
a meaningful method of using the data of the selected companies.
Selected Transactions Analysis
Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information related to the following selected
transactions involving publicly-traded target companies in the software industry announced since 2016 that Evercore
considered in its professional judgment and experience to be generally relevant for purposes of analysis, (the
“selected transactions”). The selected transactions reviewed by Evercore, and the month and year each was

For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied total enterprise value (defined as the target
company’s implied equity value based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt, plus
preferred equity and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents, less unconsolidated investments) as (i) a
multiple of last twelve-month (based on the last four reported quarters for each target company through the end of
the last such quarter prior to the announcement of the applicable transaction) revenue for the target company at the
time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which is referred to as “LTM Revenue” and (ii) a multiple of
the next twelve-month (based on the next four unreported quarters for each target company through the end of the
last such quarter after the announcement of the applicable transaction) revenue, which is referred to as “NTM
Revenue”. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the
time of announcement of the relevant transaction.

Based on the multiples it derived from the selected transactions and based on its professional judgment and
experience, Evercore selected (i) a reference range of total enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples of 5.0-9.5x and
applied this range of multiples to the Company’s LTM Revenue as of December 31, 2022 based on the financial
results for the Company provided by the Company’s management and (ii) a reference range of total enterprise value
to NTM Revenue multiples of 4.5-8.5x and applied this range of multiples to the Company’s NTM Revenue as of
December 31, 2022 based on the financial results for the Company provided by the Company’s management. Based
on this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s net debt (calculated as total debt less cash and cash
equivalents, each as of November 30, 2022, less the estimated $20 million cash consideration anticipated by the
Company’s management to be paid for the acquisition of Imburse), and the number of fully diluted shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis indicated a range of
implied equity values per share of Duck Creek Common Stock as shown below, compared to the Merger
Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock.

Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly
comparable to the Company and none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore
selected these transactions based on its professional judgment and experience because they involve companies with
business characteristics that for purposes of its analysis Evercore considered similar to the business characteristics
of the Company. In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to
general business, economic and market conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions,
and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating characteristics and other factors relevant
to the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this
analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding
many factors that could affect the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions
and the multiples derived from the selected transactions. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or
median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with
respect to its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the
following:
65
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock during the twelve-month
period ended January 6, 2023 noting that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from $10.24 to
$29.03 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
prepared and published by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of January 6, 2023, the last full
trading day prior to the delivery by Evercore of its opinion to the Special Committee. These price targets reflect
analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading price of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock at the time
the price target was published. As of January 6, 2023, the range of selected equity research analyst price targets per
share of Duck Creek Common Stock was $11.00 to $22.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity
research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and
uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future general industry and
market conditions.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price
Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Duck
Creek Common Stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of
a company’s total enterprise value as a function of that company’s estimated revenue and its assumed total
enterprise value to 2023 revenue multiple (based on the succeeding twelve-month period).
In calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Duck Creek Common Stock, Evercore first
calculated a range of implied enterprise values by multiplying estimates of the Company’s revenue based on the
Forecasts for each of calendar years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, by a range of total enterprise value to NTM
Revenue multiples of 3.5-6.5x. This range of implied total enterprise values was then discounted back to present value
using a discount rate of 12.0%, which was based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital.
Based on this range of implied enterprise values as of today, the Company’s net debt (calculated as total debt less
cash and cash equivalents, each as of November 30, 2022, less the estimated $20 million cash consideration
anticipated by the Company’s management to be paid for the acquisition of Imburse) and the number of fully diluted
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis
indicated a range of implied present prices per share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $10.95 to $23.10 (rounded to the
nearest five cents), compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed the 15 transactions outlined above under Selected
Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage
by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such transaction exceeded the unaffected
closing market prices per share of the target companies prior to announcement of each transaction.
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium
range of 30.0% to 75.0% to the closing price per share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $12.99 as of January 6, 2023.
This analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of Duck Creek Common Stock of $16.90 to $22.75
(rounded to the nearest five cents), compared to the Merger Consideration of $19.00 per share of Duck Creek
Common Stock.
Leveraged Buyout Analysis
Evercore made certain assumptions for an acquisition of the Company via a leveraged buyout (“LBO”), based
on its experience and professional judgment, including assuming (i) a 15.0-25.0% required rate of return for the LBO
acquirer, (ii) a holding period of 5.75 years, (iii) an exit multiple of 4.5- 6.5x NTM Revenue and (iv) assumed leverage
equal to 2.0x estimated average recurring revenue as of February 28, 2023, to derive a range of implied equity values
per share of Duck Creek Common Stock. This analysis indicated an implied equity value range of $11.50 to $22.05 per
share of Duck Creek Common Stock (rounded to the nearest five cents).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by Evercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the Merger by the
Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its
opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s
opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw,
in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its
opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and
experience after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses
and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual
value of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not

Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the business or
securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.
Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the
Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of
Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee, the Board or the
Company’s management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration
in the Merger for the holders of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has agreed to
pay Evercore a fee for its services in the amount of approximately $21.3 million, of which $1.5 million came due upon
delivery of Evercore’s opinion, and the balance of which will be payable contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against
certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates were not engaged to
provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and Evercore did not receive any compensation from the
Company during such period. During the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates
provided financial advisory services to Vista (“Sponsor”), an affiliate of Parent, and its affiliates and portfolio
companies for which Evercore received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $17.6
million. During the two year period prior to the date of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial
advisory services regarding matters unrelated to the Company to Apax, an affiliate of which owns more than 5% of
the Duck Creek Common Stock, and its affiliates and portfolio companies for which Evercore received fees for the
rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $16.6 million. During the two year period prior to the date
of its opinion, Evercore and its affiliates did not provide financial advisory services to Accenture LLP and Accenture
Holdings BV (“Accenture”), which owns more than 5% of the Duck Creek Common Stock. Evercore may provide
financial advisory or other services to the Company, Sponsor, Apax, Accenture or any of their respective affiliates or
portfolio companies in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of
customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity,
placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or

otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which
any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may
trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity
securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the Company,
Sponsor, Apax, Accenture or potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio
companies or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Sponsor, Apax, Accenture or any
of their respective affiliates or portfolio companies.
The Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications,
experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides
fairness opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and valuations for
corporate and other purposes."""

In connection with Duck Creek’s review of strategic alternatives, Duck Creek management prepared unaudited
forecasted financial information of Duck Creek for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2027 (the “Stand-Alone
Projections”), which were reviewed by the Board, subsequently approved by the Board on December 5, 2022, and
then used by the Board in connection with its review of strategic alternatives. The Stand-Alone Projections were
made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction, including Vista, in connection with their due
diligence review of a potential transaction. The Stand-Alone Projections were prepared from October through early
December 2022 and the Board approved the Stand-Alone Projections on December 5, 2022.
This Proxy Statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including:
•
Adjusted EBITDA (or Adj. EBITDA), which is defined as net income/loss before interest income/expense
(net), other income/expense (net), provision for income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment,
amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of
contingent consideration and acquisition-related expenses; the Company’s actual Adjusted EBITDA for
the first fiscal quarter of 2023 is calculated before severance costs relating to a reduction in force during
that quarter;
•
Non-GAAP Gross Margin, which is defined as GAAP gross margin before share-based compensation
expense, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized internal-use software that is
included in cost of revenue;
•
Non-GAAP Income from Operations, which is defined as GAAP income/loss from operations before share-
based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal-use
software that is included in cost of revenue, the change in fair value of contingent consideration and
acquisition-related expenses;
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs, which is defined as Non-GAAP Income from Operations less share-
based compensation expense, less estimated cash taxes excluding the effect of utilization of net operating
losses (“NOLs”) where applicable, plus depreciation and amortization, less changes in net working capital
(including deferred revenue), less capital expenditures and less capitalized software; and
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow post-NOLs, which is defined as Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs, plus the
effect of utilization of NOLs where applicable.
Duck Creek believes that its presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental
information to investors and management regarding Duck Creek’s financial condition and results of operations. Other
firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than Duck Creek, which limits comparability between companies.
Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP.
Although the information in the Stand-Alone Projections is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects
numerous estimates and assumptions made by Duck Creek management with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters
specific to Duck Creek’s business in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Certain key material assumptions
underlying the Stand-Alone Projections include the following:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
A majority of software sales being comprised of multi-year subscription licenses to new and existing
customers, including migrations from on-premises installations to SaaS, pursuant to Duck Creek’s strategic
focus on sales of its core SaaS offerings;
•
expansion of subscription gross margins primarily through better leveraging headcount, modifications to
subscription pricing and improvements and operational efficiency in Duck Creek’s hosting costs;
•
reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, as the Company generates greater
productivity from existing resources and hires fewer headcount or offshore headcount in the future to
reduce overall costs; and
•
expansion of Adjusted EBITDA margin resulting from scale and operational efficiencies.

On January 5, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire IMburse
AG (together with its subsidiaries, “Imburse”), and the acquisition was completed on January 25, 2023. In December
2022, in connection with the evaluation by Duck Creek management of the acquisition of Imburse, Duck Creek
management prepared unaudited forecasted financial information of Imburse for fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year
2027 (the “Imburse Projections”). The Imburse Projections treat Imburse on a stand-alone basis without giving effect
to the Merger. The Imburse Projections were made available to potential counterparties to a strategic transaction,
including Vista, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction.
Although the information in the Imburse Projections is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
estimates and assumptions made by Duck Creek management with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Imburse’s
business, in each case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and
many of which are beyond the Company’s control. Certain key material assumptions underlying the Imburse
Projections include the following:
•
Imburse focusing on sales of its core payments offerings with a majority of software sales being comprised
of subscription license agreements to new customers;
•
commercial sales only in EMEA during fiscal 2023 and sales to US customers commencing in the first fiscal
quarter of 2024;
•
increase in gross margins, primarily resulting from scale in revenue and covering operational fixed costs;
and
•
growth in Adjusted EBITDA, primarily resulting from growth in revenue and scale of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The projections summarized in the table below for the Company’s second through fourth fiscal quarters 2023
through fiscal year 2032 (the “Forecasts”) were prepared on the following basis:
•
projections for fiscal year 2023 reflect actual results from the first fiscal quarter for 2023, as reported by the
Company after the approval of the Stand-Alone Projections;
•
projections for the second through fourth fiscal quarters of 2023 and through 2027 mathematically compute
the combination of the Stand-Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections (which were each unrounded,
but rounded to the nearest million dollars once combined) for those periods; the estimated earnings used to
calculate Adjusted EBITDA included in the Forecasts for the second through fourth fiscal quarters of 2023
include approximately $600,000 in acquisition-related expenses relating to the acquisition of Imburse;
•
projections for fiscal years 2028 through 2032 were extrapolated based on the Stand-Alone Projections and
the Imburse Projections;
•
Unlevered Free Cash Flow pre-NOLs and Unlevered Free Cash Flow post-NOLs for the second through
fourth fiscal quarters of 2023 and through fiscal year 2032, as set forth in the table immediately below, were
calculated based on the projections summarized in the preceding rows in such table; and
•
cash tax savings from estimated usage of NOL carryforwards for the second through fourth fiscal quarters
of 2023 and through fiscal year 2032, as set forth in the table immediately below, were calculated based on
the projections summarized in the preceding rows in such table.
Although the information in the table below is presented with numerical specificity, it reflects numerous
estimates and assumptions made with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory,
market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to Duck Creek’s business, in each
case as of the date it was prepared, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are

The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts treat Duck Creek on a stand-alone
basis without giving effect to, and as if Duck Creek never contemplated, the Merger, including the impact of
negotiating or executing the Merger Agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating
the Merger, the effect of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the
Merger Agreement having been executed or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would
likely have been taken if the Merger Agreement had not been executed but which were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger.
The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure and the summary thereof is included in this Proxy Statement only because (i) the Stand-Alone
Projections were made available to the Board in connection with its review of strategic alternatives, (ii) the Stand-
Alone Projections and the Imburse Projections were made available to potential counterparties to a strategic
transaction, including Vista, in connection with their due diligence review of a potential transaction, and (iii) the
Forecasts were used by JPM for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion

TABLE OF CONTENTS
provided to the Board and by Evercore for purposes of preparing its financial analyses and fairness opinion provided
to the Special Committee, each on January 8, 2023, as described in the section entitled “The Merger-Opinions of Duck
Creek’s Financial Advisors” beginning on page 55 of this Proxy Statement. The summary of the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not being included in this Proxy Statement to influence your
decision whether to vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse
Projections and the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines
established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of
prospective financial information, or GAAP (and do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP).
Neither KPMG LLP, Duck Creek’s independent registered public accounting firm (“KPMG”), nor any other audit firm
has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts and, accordingly, KPMG has not expressed an opinion or any
other form of assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG report included in Duck Creek’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended August 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement, relates to Duck
Creek’s historical financial information and does not extend to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections
or the Forecasts and should not be read to do so.
The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts are subject to estimates and
assumptions in many respects and, as a result, subject to interpretation and reflect subjective judgment in many
respects, and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual results and
business developments. While presented with numerical specificity, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse
Projections and the Forecasts are based upon a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,
though considered reasonable by Duck Creek management as of the date of their preparation. These estimates and
assumptions may prove to be inaccurate for any number of reasons, which are difficult to predict and which are
beyond Duck Creek’s control, including general economic conditions, competition and the risks discussed in this
Proxy Statement under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
beginning on page 22 of this Proxy Statement. The Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the
Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Because the Stand-
Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts cover multiple years, by their nature, they become
subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year and are unlikely to anticipate each and every circumstance
that could have an effect on Duck Creek’s business and its results of operations. There can be no assurance that the
projections contained in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts will be realized, and
actual results may differ materially from those shown therein.
The information in the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts is not factual and
should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The inclusion of the summary of the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts in this Proxy Statement should not be regarded
as an indication that Duck Creek or anyone else then considered, or now considers, such summaries to be necessarily
predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. In light of the foregoing,
Duck Creek’s stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance thereon. The Stand-Alone Projections, the
Imburse Projections and the Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial
statements and other information regarding Duck Creek contained in Duck Creek’s public filings with the SEC.
None of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other
representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ from the Stand-Alone Projections, the
Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update, or otherwise revise or
reconcile, the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing
after the date the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts were generated or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Stand-Alone
Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, as applicable, are shown to be in error. Since the date of the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections and the Forecasts, Duck Creek has made publicly available its
actual results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, ended November 30, 2022. You should review Duck
Creek’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on January 9, 2023 for information about Duck Creek’s
actual results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2022. Duck Creek does not intend to make
publicly available any update or other revision to the Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the
Forecasts, even in the event that any or all assumptions
71

are shown to be in error. Except as required by applicable law, none of Duck Creek, its financial advisors or its or their
respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to
any Company stockholder or any other person (including Vista, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise) regarding the
Stand-Alone Projections, the Imburse Projections or the Forecasts, Duck Creek’s ultimate performance compared to
the information contained therein or that forecasted results will be achieved."""

In considering the recommendation of the Board that holders of Duck Creek Common Stock vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement, our stockholders should be aware that certain of Duck Creek’s non-employee directors and
executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Duck Creek’s
stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in approving
the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Company
stockholders.
Treatment of Duck Creek Common Stock

director or executive officer since the beginning of the last fiscal year), as a group, hold 3,155,880 shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock, excluding any unvested Company RSAs.
At the Effective Time, each share of Duck Creek Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is held by Duck Creek’s directors and executive officers will be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $19.00, without interest.

each Company RSA granted after January 8, 2023 will not be fully vested and will instead remain subject to the same
terms and conditions and be paid out on the same vesting schedule as applied to such Company RSA prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the holder’s continued employment or service through the applicable vesting date. None of

See the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement for an estimate of the amounts that would

Payments Upon Termination At or Following Change in Control
Each of our executive officers is party to a written employment arrangement with Duck Creek Technologies LLC,
a subsidiary of Duck Creek, pursuant to which the executive officer will receive the following severance payments
and benefits upon a termination of the executive officer’s employment without cause or, in the case of Messrs.
Jackowski, Rhodes and Van Biert, resignation for good reason (as defined in the applicable employment agreement)
following the consummation of the Merger, subject to each executive officer’s execution of a general release of
claims:
•
Mr. Jackowski will receive (i) an amount equal to the sum of his then-current annual base salary and target
annual bonus, payable in twelve equal monthly installments following the date of termination or in a lump
sum if such termination takes place within one year following the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a pro-
rated annual incentive bonus for the year of termination, payable based on actual performance at the same
time that such bonuses are paid to other senior executives with respect to the year of termination, (iii)
payment of the employer contributions for twelve months of continued health coverage costs payable in
four quarterly installments following the termination date and (iv) twelve months of outplacement services
not to exceed $20,000.
•
Mr. Rhodes will receive (i) continued payments of his annual base salary and target annual bonus for a
period of twelve months following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such termination takes place
within one year following the consummation of the Merger, (ii) a pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the
year of termination, payable based on actual performance at the same time that such bonuses are paid to
other senior executives with respect to the year of termination, and (iii) continued medical coverage at
active employee rates for twelve months following the termination date (“Continued Medical Coverage”).
•
Mr. Van Biert will receive (i) continued payments of his annual base salary for a period of twelve months

•
Mr. Vaidyanathan will receive continued payments of his annual base salary for a period of twelve months
following the date of termination or in a lump sum if such termination takes place within one
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
year following the consummation of the Merger. Though Mr. Vaidyanathan is entitled to receive the
Continued Medical Coverage under the terms of his employment agreement, he will not receive any health
benefits in connection with the consummation of the Merger as he does not participate in Duck Creek’s
health plans.
•
Ms. Harris and Messrs. Chippari and Foster are no longer employed by Duck Creek and will not receive any
severance payments or benefits in connection with the consummation of the Merger.
Each of our executive officers has also entered into a restrictive covenants agreement with Duck Creek
Technologies LLC, which provides that, during the course of each executive officer’s employment and for the one-
year period following termination of his or her employment for any reason, each executive officer will not compete
with, or solicit any vendors, customers, suppliers, employees, consultants or agents of, Duck Creek Technologies
LLC or its affiliates. The restrictive covenants agreement further provides that each executive officer may not disclose
any proprietary, trade secret or confidential information involving Duck Creek Technologies LLC or its affiliates and
will assign all applicable intellectual property rights to them.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of Duck Creek and
its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements with employees and indemnified persons, which are any
of their current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Duck Creek or any
of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), for any acts or omissions by such indemnified persons or employees
occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
similar organizational documents of the subsidiaries of Duck Creek, as applicable, as of the date of the Merger
Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
adverse manner except as required by applicable law.
In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, during the six-year period commencing at the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
current or former director or officer of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries (and any person who becomes a director or
officer of Duck Creek or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), to the fullest extent permitted by law or
pursuant to any indemnification agreements with Duck Creek and its subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, from and against all costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection
with any legal proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as an affiliate, director, officer,
employee or agent of Duck Creek, its subsidiaries or their affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or
alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (2) the Merger, as well as any actions taken
by Duck Creek or its subsidiaries or the Buyer Parties with respect thereto. The Merger Agreement also provides that
Duck Creek and its subsidiaries will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as
incurred by any such indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding.
The Merger Agreement also provides that Duck Creek may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Duck Creek’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier on the
date of the Merger Agreement on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and
amounts) that are no less favorable than those of Duck Creek’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies as
in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limits on the aggregate cost for such “tail” policy.
The “tail” policy will cover claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, without limiting the foregoing, the Merger Agreement requires Parent to cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, on terms no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, Duck Creek’s directors’ and
officers’ insurance policies for a period of at least six years commencing at the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy or the “tail” policy to the extent such
premiums exceed, on an annual basis, 300% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Duck Creek, and if
the premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Arrangements with Parent
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of our executive officers has had any discussions or negotiations,
or entered into any agreement, with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding the potential terms of their individual
employment arrangements or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of Parent or one or more of its affiliates
following the consummation of the Merger. Prior to or following the consummation of the Merger, however, certain
executive officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent, the Company or their respective
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, Parent or one or more of
its affiliates after the Effective Time.
Golden Parachute Compensation

The obligation of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition.
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
the Company stockholders in the Merger is approximately $2.65 billion in cash.
In connection with the financing of the Merger, Vista Fund VIII and Parent have entered into an Equity
Commitment Letter, pursuant to which Vista Fund VIII has agreed to provide Parent with an equity commitment of up
to approximately $2.65 billion in cash, which will be available, together with cash on hand at Duck Creek as of the
Closing, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the Company stockholders (including payments in
respect of our outstanding equity-based awards payable in connection with the Closing pursuant to the Merger
Agreement) and to pay the fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid in connection with the Closing by
Duck Creek and the Buyer Parties.
The Equity Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that: (1) Duck Creek is an express third-party
beneficiary thereof in connection with Duck Creek’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the
Merger Agreement; and (2) Vista Fund VIII will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief in connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights. The Equity Commitment
Letter may not be waived, amended or modified except by a written instrument signed by Parent and Vista Fund VIII.
Limited Guarantee
Pursuant to the Limited Guarantee, Vista Fund VIII has agreed to guarantee the due and punctual payment to
Duck Creek of all of the liabilities and obligations of the Buyer Parties under the Merger Agreement (the “Guaranteed
Obligations”).
The obligations of Vista Fund VIII under the Limited Guarantee are subject to an aggregate cap equal to the
Parent Liability Limitation.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Limited Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest of:
•
immediately following the later of the Effective Time and the deposit of the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to the Company stockholders with the designated payment agent;
•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by mutual written consent of Duck Creek, Parent and
Merger Sub;
•
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement by Duck Creek in those certain circumstances specified in
the Limited Guarantee;

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may
be relevant to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) whose shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in
effect on the date of this Proxy Statement and all of which are subject to change or to differing interpretations at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to Company stockholders who hold their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock as
“capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). In
addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign
jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate or gift
taxation) or the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax that may be relevant or
applicable to a particular holder in connection with the Merger. For purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means
either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may require.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not address all of the tax consequences that
may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances nor does it address any consequences to holders
subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law, including, for example:
•
banks or other financial institutions;
•
mutual funds;
•
insurance companies;
•
tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other
governmental organizations;
•
retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts;
•
S corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities or arrangements);
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that accumulates
earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;
•
dealers or brokers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•
traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
•
regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts, or entities subject to the U.S. anti-
inversion rules;
•
U.S. expatriates or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•
holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of Duck Creek
Common Stock (by vote or value);
•
holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk
reduction transaction;
•
holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the
shares of Duck Creek Common Stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as
defined in the Code);
•
holders that received their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in a compensatory transaction, through a
tax-qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•
holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger;
•
U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or
•
holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and properly demand appraisal of their shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or non-U.S., treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, then the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and
the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock and partners therein should consult their
tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.
No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Merger described herein. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a
court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.
THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE
MERGER. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR OTHER TAX LAWS. 
U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
•
a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of
one or more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (2) that has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person as defined in section
7701(a)(30) of the Code.
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Duck Creek Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss generally
will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount
that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the
completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-
corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S.
Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must
determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common
Stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Subject to the discussion under “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, any gain realized by
a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•
The gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise), and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of thirty percent
(30%) (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•
such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for one hundred and eighty-three
(183) days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in
which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%) (or
a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty), which gain may be offset by certain U.S. source capital
losses of such Non-U.S. Holder; or
•
Duck Creek is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code (“USRPHC”), at any time within the shorter of the five (5)-year period preceding
the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of Duck Creek
Common Stock (the “Relevant Period”) and, if shares of Duck Creek Common Stock are regularly traded on
an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S.
Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than five percent (5%) of Duck
Creek Common Stock at any time during the Relevant Period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),
except that the branch profits tax will not apply. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, we
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five (5)-year period preceding
the Merger.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the Merger.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (currently, at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%)) may also apply
to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a
U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (i) provides a
certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a
79
TABLE OF CONTENTS
substitute or successor form) or (ii) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability; provided that the holder timely furnishes the required
information to the IRS.
THE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAXATION THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO PARTICULAR HOLDERS. IT IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES OF DUCK

with all regulatory notification requirements, and to obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include approval under,
or notifications pursuant to, the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust laws (whether domestic or foreign).
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Duck Creek
and Vista Fund VIII file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a
thirty (30) calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or
the early termination of that waiting period. Duck Creek and Vista Fund VIII made the necessary filings with the FTC
and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on January 18, 2023. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Time on February 17, 2023.
At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate,
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the
Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include
seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private
parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances."""

On February 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the O’Dell Complaint, naming as defendants
Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On February 22, 2023 a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the
Reddiar Complaint, naming as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board. On February 22, 2023 a
purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the Dangerfield Complaint, naming as defendants Duck Creek and each
member of the Board. On February 23, 2023 a purported stockholder of Duck Creek filed the Powell Complaint, naming
as defendants Duck Creek and each member of the Board.
The Complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act and also that the Board breached its fiduciary duties. Specifically, one or more of the Complaints allege
that the Preliminary Proxy Statement contains materially incomplete and misleading representations and information
concerning the Company’s financial forecasts, the financial analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore in
support of their respective fairness opinions, the scope of the non-disclosure agreements entered into between Duck
Creek and potential bidders in connection with a potential strategic transaction involving Duck Creek and potential
conflicts of interests of certain insiders of Duck Creek. The relief sought in one or more of the Complaints includes
enjoining the consummation of the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material
information, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms thereof,
granting rescissory damages, directing the defendants to
 
80
 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
disseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all required
or necessary material facts, directing the defendants to account for all alleged damages suffered as a result of the
defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act
as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and awarding the plaintiffs their respective costs and disbursements,
including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.
Duck Creek believes that the Complaints are without merit and Duck Creek and the individual defendants intend
to defend against the Complaints; however, Duck Creek cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be
required to resolve the Complaints, nor the outcomes thereof.
The outcome of any pending or future litigation is uncertain. Such litigation, if not resolved, could prevent or
delay consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Duck Creek, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
Merger will be in effect, nor will any action have been taken by any governmental authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of competent jurisdiction, and no statute, rule, regulation or order will have been enacted, entered
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation
of the Merger. Therefore, if a plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being consummated, or from
being consummated within the expected time frame.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” means an agreement with Duck Creek that contains customary
provisions requiring the counterparty thereto (and any of its affiliates and representatives) that receive material non-
public information of or with respect to Duck Creek and its subsidiaries to keep such information confidential;
provided that the provisions contained therein are no less restrictive in any material respect to such counterparty
(and any of its affiliates and representatives named therein) than the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered
into between Duck Creek and Vista (except that such agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provision
or otherwise prohibit the making of any Acquisition Proposal).
“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by the Buyer Parties) to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction.
“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger)
involving:

Any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons (in each case, other than the Buyer Parties, their affiliates or
any group that includes the Buyer Parties or their affiliates), whether from Duck Creek or any other
person(s), of securities representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity
securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after giving effect to the consummation of such
purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or
“group” of persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or
“group” of persons beneficially owning more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity
securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after giving effect to the consummation of such
tender or exchange offer;
(ii)
Any direct or indirect purchase, license or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined pursuant
to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons of assets constituting or accounting for more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the consolidated assets, revenue or net income of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition); or
(iii) Any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution
or other transaction involving Duck Creek pursuant to which any person or “group” (as defined pursuant

percent (15%) of the total outstanding equity securities of Duck Creek (by vote or economic interests) after
giving effect to the consummation of such transaction.
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement” means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement.
“Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction on terms
that the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory
and financing aspects of the proposal (including certainty of closing) and the identity of the person making the
proposal and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee deems relevant, and if
consummated, would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company stockholders (in their
capacity as such) than the Merger (taking into account any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination). For purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition Proposal”
in this definition, all references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be

In addition, from the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, from the date of the

Duck Creek and its subsidiaries agreed not to, and to not instruct, authorize or knowingly permit any of their affiliates

that has made or delivered to the Company an Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date (or, with
respect to an Excluded Party, after the date of the Merger Agreement), and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition
Proposal or assist such person (and its affiliates, representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition
Proposal (in each case, if requested by such person), in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from any material breach of Duck Creek’s obligations, as described in the immediately two preceding
paragraphs; provided, however, that the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by
the above would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; provided further, however, that
the Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning Duck Creek and its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or its affiliates or
representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.
Duck Creek is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement for the purpose of entering into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, unless it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including but not
limited to, negotiating with Parent and its representatives in good faith over a four business day period in an effort to
amend the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal contemplated by such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement no longer constitutes a “Superior Proposal” relative to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as amended pursuant to such negotiations.
If Duck Creek terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Company
stockholders for the purpose of entering into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, Duck Creek must pay the
Company Termination Fee of $78,337,343; provided that if (A) such termination occurs prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date, (B) the Company enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with any person other than
an Excluded Party to consummate an Acquisition Transaction at the time of such termination and (C) no Excluded
Party has provided equity financing for, or any other investment in, such Acquisition Transaction, then the Company
Termination Fee shall be reduced to $39,168,671.
A breach of these “no-solicitation” provisions of the Merger Agreement by any director, officer or other
representative of Duck Creek (other than a consultant or an employee of Duck Creek who is not an officer of Duck
Creek) will be deemed to be a breach of such provisions by Duck Creek. Duck Creek may not authorize, direct or
knowingly permit any consultant or employee of a Duck Creek to breach these “no-solicitation” provisions of the
Merger Agreement, and upon becoming aware of any breach or threatened breach of these provisions by a
consultant or employee of Duck Creek, will use its reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened breach."""

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation
that the Company stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special Committee) will not effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change (as defined below) except as described below.
Prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special
Committee) may not take any action described in the following (any such action, a “Company Board
Recommendation Change”):
•
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or
modify, the Board’s recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect;
•
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
•
fail to publicly reaffirm the Board’s recommendation within ten business days after Parent so requests in
writing (it being understood that Duck Creek will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more

including the Special Committee) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
until the close of business on the tenth business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer
in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of the
Merger Agreement); or
•
fail to include the Board’s recommendation in this Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if
(1) there has been an Intervening Event or (2) the Special Committee determines that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal.
The Board may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event if the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if:
•
Duck Creek has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance to the
effect that the Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the Special Committee has (1)
so determined; and (2) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, which notice must specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, Duck Creek and its representatives,
during such four (4) business day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good
faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Special Committee no longer determines that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.
In addition, the Board may only effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, or authorize Duck Creek to
terminate the Merger Agreement and to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in response to a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if:
•
the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law;
•
Duck Creek and its subsidiaries and their representatives have otherwise complied in all material respects
with its obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
•
Duck Creek has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance (the
“Notice Period”) to the effect that the Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, has (1) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2)
concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (3) resolved
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate the Merger Agreement absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the person or “group” of
persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal;
•
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, Duck Creek and its
representatives, during the Notice Period, have negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;

The Merger Agreement provides that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor all of the
benefit plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
benefit plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, after the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the “Continuation
Period”), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will provide employee benefits (other than defined benefit
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-employment or retiree health or welfare, change in control,
retention or equity-based benefits) to each individual who is an employee of Duck Creek and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues to be an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) (a “Continuing Employee”) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each case, during the
Continuation Period, base compensation and target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (other than
equity or equity-based incentive arrangements) will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the
Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation will also provide severance benefits to eligible employees in
accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on January 8, 2023.
The Surviving Corporation will grant any Continuing Employee credit for all service with Duck Creek and its

purpose as such service was credited under a Duck Creek employee benefit plan or arrangement before the Effective
Time and (iii) no service shall be required to be credited under any plan that provides for equity or equity-based,
defined benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-employment or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, the
Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such plans replaces
coverage previously provided under a comparable Duck Creek benefit plan or arrangement in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time; (ii) during the plan year in which the Closing Date

provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of
the plan will be waived for the Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and full credit will be given

Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific
performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific performance of
the obligation to consummate the Merger) or (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty

“Debt Financing”). The Company’s obligations include, but are not limited to, upon reasonable advance notice,
reasonably cooperating with the marketing and due diligence efforts for any of the Debt Financing, providing
reasonable assistance with the timely preparation of documents required in connection with or proper for the Debt
Financing, subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In no event will the Company or any of its subsidiaries be required to (i) waive or amend any terms of the
Merger Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it has not
received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement or distribute any cash (except to the extent subject to concurrent reimbursement by Parent) that will be
effective prior to the Closing Date; (iii) give any indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing that are effective
prior to the Effective Time; (iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or create an
unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (v)
take any action that will conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable laws or would result in
a material violation or breach of, or default under, any material agreement to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party.

forth in the Merger Agreement, to consummate the Merger.

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that Duck Creek provide Company stockholders
with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation that
will or may become payable by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed in the section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-
Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement.
Company stockholders are asked to indicate their approval of the compensation that will or may become payable
by Duck Creek to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the
section entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 75 of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously
formed part of Duck Creek’s overall compensation program for its named executive officers, and previously have been
disclosed to Company stockholders as part of the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and related sections of
Duck Creek’s annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of independent directors, and are believed to be
reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.
Accordingly, Duck Creek is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Duck Creek Technologies, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to Duck Creek’s named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section
entitled “Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Duck Creek in the Merger-Golden Parachute
Compensation” in Duck Creek’s Proxy Statement for the Special Meeting of stockholders.”
Company stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger, and as
an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Duck Creek, the Board or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of the
outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, Duck Creek’s named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments."""

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common Stock who do not
vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly exercise and perfect his, her or its demand
for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL
and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is accessible, without subscription or
cost, at the following publicly available website: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262 and
incorporated by reference herein. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. All references in
Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
unless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein, and all such references to a “beneficial owner” mean a person
who is the beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person unless otherwise expressly noted therein or herein.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is consummated, stockholders and beneficial owners of Duck Creek Common
Stock who (i) deliver a written demand for appraisal of their shares of Duck Creek Common Stock before the taking of
the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the Merger, (iii) continuously
hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable of such shares through the Effective Time, and (iv) otherwise follow
the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and
to receive in lieu of the Merger Consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to
be the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair
value as determined by the Court of Chancery (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash
payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262). Unless the Court of
Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at five percent (5%) over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period;
provided that, if at any time before the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of
such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and
the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of
such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such
voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking
appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement
if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice either a copy of Section 262 or information
directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 may be accessed without
subscription or cost. This Proxy Statement constitutes Duck Creek’s notice to Company stockholders that appraisal
rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed,
without subscription or cost, at the following publicly available website:
https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262. In connection with the Merger, any holder or beneficial
owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve
such person’s right to do so should review the following summary and the applicable statutory provisions carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
Company stockholders and beneficial owners who assert appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds one percent (1%) of
the outstanding shares of Duck Creek Common Stock measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of
the DGCL or (ii) the value of the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock for which appraisal rights have been
106
TABLE OF CONTENTS
pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, Duck Creek believes that if a Company stockholder or beneficial
owner is considering exercising appraisal rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel. A Company
stockholder or beneficial owner who loses his, her, or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in the Merger Agreement upon surrender of the certificates that formerly represented
such shares of Duck Creek Common Stock.
Company stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of
Duck Creek Common Stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the
following:
•
the person must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
the person must deliver to Duck Creek a written demand for appraisal before the vote on proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement by itself does not constitute a
demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform
us of the identity of the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, and the intention of such person to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner's failure to make a written
demand for appraisal before the vote with respect to the Merger is taken will constitute a waiver of
appraisal rights;
•
the person must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective
Time (a stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers
the shares before the Effective Time); and
•
the person, another stockholder or beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal rights or the
Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair
value of the shares within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock.
Because a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.
Making a Written Demand
Any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must
deliver to Duck Creek, before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a
written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s or beneficial owner shares. The person making the written
demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made, and such person must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which
such demand relates through the effective date of the Merger.
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement either by ballot or by proxy. In the case of a holder of record shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal
and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy
and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In the case
of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in “street
name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote

Making a Written Demand
Any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must
deliver to Duck Creek, before the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a
written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s or beneficial owner shares. The person making the written
demand must be a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, as applicable, on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made, and such person must continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, the shares as to which
such demand relates through the effective date of the Merger.
A person wishing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement either by ballot or by proxy. In the case of a holder of record shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock a proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder’s right to appraisal
and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy
and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. In the case
of a beneficial owner, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Duck Creek Common Stock in “street
name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote
107
TABLE OF CONTENTS
those shares on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement without specific voting instructions from the beneficial
owner on such proposal, but such brokers, banks or other nominees will vote such shares as instructed if the
beneficial owner provides such instructions. If a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” instructs such
person's broker, bank or other nominee to vote such person's shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, and does not revoke such instruction prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
then such shares will be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will cause such beneficial
owner to lose his, her or its right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either not provide any instructions to such
person's broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or must instruct
such broker, bank or other nominee to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on
such proposal. Neither voting against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or
failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s failure
to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
Special Meeting will cause such person to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.
A demand for appraisal made by a Company stockholder or beneficial owner should be executed by or on behalf
of the holder of record or beneficial owner, as applicable, and must reasonably inform Duck Creek of the identity of
such stockholder or beneficial owner. In addition, in the case of a demand for appraisal of such beneficial owner, the
demand must also (1) reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, (2) be
accompanied by documentary evidence of the beneficial owner’s ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or
securities account statement containing such information or a letter from the broker or other record holder of such
shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of
what it purports to be and (3) provide an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given
by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 and the verified list required by subsection (f) of Section 262
(discussed further below). Whether made by a Company stockholder or a beneficial owner, a written demand for
appraisal must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the person's shares in connection with
the Merger. If the shares are held of record or beneficially owned in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of such holder of record or beneficial owner,
and if the shares are held of record or beneficially owned by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a
tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all such joint holders of record or beneficial
owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint stockholders or beneficial owners,
may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record or beneficial owner; however, the agent must
identify the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners, respectively, and should expressly disclose that,
in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record holder or holders or beneficial owner or owners,
as applicable.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:

beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder,
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all persons entitled to appraisal. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and Company stockholders and beneficial owners
should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair values of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock. Accordingly, any holders or beneficial owners of Duck Creek
Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be
responsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The
failure of a holder or beneficial owner of Duck Creek Common Stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the
period specified in Section 262 will nullify the person’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck
Creek Common Stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, will be entitled,
upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the Merger proposal and with respect to which Duck Creek received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares of such
common stock (provided that, in the case of a demand made by a beneficial owner in such person's name, the record
holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such
aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting person within ten (10) days
after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Duck Creek Common Stock
and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within
twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all persons who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to
the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders and beneficial owners as required
by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of
Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to
comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person."""
"DUCK CREEK TECHNOLOGIES, INC._20230228_DEFM14A_20680687_4596980.Pdf",Determination of Fair Value,109,118,Termination,"""
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. The Court
of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
109
TABLE OF CONTENTS
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery of will take into account all
relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court”
should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. The Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that transaction price is one of the relevant factors the Court
of Chancery may consider in determining “fair value” and that absent deficiencies in the sale process the transaction
price should be given “considerable weight”. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders and beneficial owners considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares as so determined by the Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration
they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is
not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Duck
Creek believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders and beneficial owners should recognize that
such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger
Consideration. Neither Duck Creek nor Parent anticipates offering more than the $19.00 per share Merger
Consideration to any person exercising appraisal rights. Each of Duck Creek and Parent reserves the right to assert, in
any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of Duck Creek Common Stock
is less than the $19.00 per share Merger Consideration.
Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at five
percent (5%) over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment; provided that if at any time before
the Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation pays to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the
amount that equals the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares
as determined by the Court of Chancery and (ii) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment,
unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment
prior to such entry of judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the
fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of
Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may
also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised not dismissed pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL or subject to
such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Section 262(k) of the DGCL.
If any stockholder or beneficial owner who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Duck Creek Common
Stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, the
person’s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the
Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding taxes. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw,
the person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within one hundred
110
TABLE OF CONTENTS
twenty (120) days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder or beneficial owner, as applicable, delivers to the
Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in respect to some or all of such
person’s shares and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares subject to withdrawal in
accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote Duck
Creek Common Stock for any purpose, or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the person’s shares of Duck Creek Common Stock, if any, payable to Company
stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, any Company stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is
encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.
STOCKHOLDERS AND BENEFICIAL OWNERS WHO VOTE SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT
THERETO BUT, RATHER, WILL RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.
OTHER MATTERS
The sole business that may be considered at the Special Meeting are the matters set forth in the Notice of
Special Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement.
FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any
future meetings of Company stockholders. However, if the Merger is not consummated, Company stockholders will
continue to be entitled to attend and participate in Company stockholders’ meetings.
As described in our annual proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders filed on December 28,
2022, any proposal or proposals by a Company stockholder intended to be included in the proxy statement and form
of proxy relating to the annual meeting of Company stockholders to be held in 2024 must comply with the procedures
set forth in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. To be eligible for inclusion, your proposal(s) must be received by the
Company no later than August 30, 2023. Proposals should be sent to the Secretary of the Company at its principal
executive offices, 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
require the Company to include in its proxy statement and proxy relating to the annual meeting of stockholders to be
held in 2024 any Company stockholder proposal which may be omitted from the proxy materials according to
applicable regulations of the SEC in effect at the time the proposal is received.
A Company stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nominate a candidate to serve as a director for
consideration at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024 outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act must timely deliver a written notice in accordance with the requirements, including eligibility and
information required in such notice, set forth in Sections 2.15 and 2.16 of the Company’s amended and restated
bylaws. To be timely, such written notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive
offices, 22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10, Boston, MA 02210, not earlier than the close of business on October 25,
2023, nor later than the close of business on November 24, 2023. In the event that the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in 2024 is not scheduled to occur within twenty-five (25) days before or after February 22, 2024 (the
anniversary of the 2023 annual meeting), the written notice must be received by the Company not later than the close
of business on the tenth (10th) day following (i) the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting for 2024 is
mailed or (ii) the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made, whichever first occurs.
In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements, to comply with the SEC’s universal proxy rules, Company
stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than our nominees must provide

held in 2024 any Company stockholder proposal which may be omitted from the proxy materials according to
applicable regulations of the SEC in effect at the time the proposal is received.
A Company stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nominate a candidate to serve as a director for

2023, nor later than the close of business on November 24, 2023. In the event that the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in 2024 is not scheduled to occur within twenty-five (25) days before or after February 22, 2024 (the

A-19
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $19.00,
without interest thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company Group; (B) owned by

extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.
(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately (and subject to
the terms of the Charter) to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock distribution or dividend
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to Company Capital Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by

writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant
to this Section 2.7 Holders of Dissenting Company Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.
(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such
demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.7(c)(ii),
“participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to
the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands but will
not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the payment,
settlement or compromise consent set forth above.
2.8 Equity Awards.
(a) Company RSAs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company RSA, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested, cancelled and

number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSA, multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Company RSA Consideration”).
A-20
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(b) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company RSU, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested, cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Company RSU Consideration”).
(c) Company Phantom Stock Awards. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company
Phantom Stock Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock measured by reference
to such Company Phantom Stock Award, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes (the “Company Phantom Stock Award Consideration”).
(d) Company Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the applicable per share exercise price
under such Company Option, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Company Option
Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Company
Option shall be cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 2.8(d) without payment
or consideration.
(e) Company SARs. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company SAR, whether vested
or unvested, that is unexpired, unexercised, and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be fully vested, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR,
multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the applicable per share exercise price under such
Company SAR, subject to any required withholding of Taxes (the “Company SAR Consideration”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company SAR that is not an In-the-Money Company SAR shall be
cancelled immediately upon the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 2.8(e) without payment or consideration.
(f) Payment Procedures. The Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay no later
than the first payroll date following the Closing Date the aggregate Company Option Consideration, Company
Phantom Stock Award Consideration, Company RSA Consideration, Company RSU Consideration, and
Company SAR Consideration, as applicable, payable with respect to each of the Company Options, Company
Phantom Stock Awards, Company RSAs, Company RSUs and Company SARs, respectively, through the
Company Group’s payroll to the applicable holders of such Company Options, Company Phantom Stock
Awards, Company RSAs, Company RSUs, and Company SARs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment
owed to such holders cannot be made through the Company Group’s payroll system or payroll provider, then
the Company Group will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight
courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event later than the first payroll date
following the Closing Date).
(g) Further Actions. The Company will pass resolutions approving and take other actions as may be
reasonably necessary or required to effect the cancellation of Company Options, Company Phantom Stock
Awards, Company RSUs, Company RSAs and Company SARs upon the Effective Time, and to give effect to
this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange
Act). The Company Equity Plan will terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Employee
Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock or other
equity interests of the Company Group will be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and the Company will take all
action necessary to effect the foregoing. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time, no participant in the Company Equity Plan or other Employee Plan will have any
right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

2.9 Exchange of Certificates.
(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) Parent
will enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with
such Payment Agent.
(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which such holders become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7; provided that the Company shall, at the written
request of Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Closing such portion of such aggregate consideration
from the Company Group’s Cash on Hand as specified in such request. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more
than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the
“Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is
unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.
(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Closing (and in any event within three Business Days
following the Closing), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting
Company Shares and Owned Company Shares, as applicable) (the “Certificates”); (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares, as applicable)
(the “Uncertificated Shares”): (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Price, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per
Share Price (subject to Section 2.12), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon
receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock represented
by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (subject to Section 2.12), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such
Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Per Share Price, payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to this
A-22
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to
the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.7.
(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures
with the Payment Agent and the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by
(B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the
first Business Day after the Closing Date.
(e) Transfers of Ownership. Subject, in all cases, to the terms and conditions of the Charter in respect of
Company Capital Stock, if a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock is not registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred is registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, as applicable, only if, in the case of Company Capital Shares
represented by Certificates, such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer, or in the case of Uncertificated Shares, a proper transfer instruction is presented, and in either case the
Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.
(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the
Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock, for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.
(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the
Closing Date, as applicable, will be delivered to Parent (as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, who
have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Capital Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of
the Per Share Price without interest thereon, payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price, to which such
holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Closing Date, or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.
2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares
of Company Capital Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be converted or cancelled and retired,
as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.7 and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Capital Stock will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price, payable therefor in accordance with
A-23
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance
with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.
2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such customary amount as it may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

by the Company in connection with the Merger and the Equity Financing.
(d) Validity. The Equity Commitment Letter (in the form delivered by Parent to the Company) is in full

pursuant to any agreement relating to the Equity Financing to which the Guarantor, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, is a party. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or the
Guarantor pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent is not making any
representation or warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in
Article III or the Company’s compliance hereunder). As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Equity Financing to be
satisfied by it, whether or not such term or condition is contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (it being

the representations and warranties in Article III or the Company’s compliance hereunder). As of the date hereof,

financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in

its Affiliates), director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company Group (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or
the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to

such holder’s shares of Company Capital Stock; (ii) such holder of Company Capital Stock has agreed to approve
this Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder, director, officer, employee or other

fees and expenses of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith), (a) the amount

mature. For purposes of the foregoing, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent
and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

by this Section 5.3(b), request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the
Company Group theretofore furnished to any such Person with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered
into at any time within the six month period immediately preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date and will (A)
cease providing any further information with respect to the Company or any Acquisition Proposal to any such
Person or its Representatives; and (B) terminate all access granted to any such Person and its Representatives
to any physical or electronic data room. Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(c), from the No-Shop Period Start
Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, from the date hereof) until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company Group will not, and will not
instruct, authorize or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any
proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to
any Person (other than to Parent or any designees of Parent) any non-public information relating to the
Company Group or afford to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company Group (other than Parent or any designees of Parent),
in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.3 and contacting the Person making the Acquisition Proposal to the extent necessary to clarify the
terms of the Acquisition Proposal); (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”). From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will not be required
to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, (i) any anti-clubbing, restrictions on engaging Representatives or
working with potential Financing Sources or similar provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement and
(ii) any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such provision prohibits
or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Special Committee.
(c) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in this Section 5.3, from the No-
Shop Period Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, from the date hereof) until the Company’s receipt
of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Special Committee may, directly or indirectly
through one or more of their Representatives (including the Advisors), participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company Group to, or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company Group pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to any Person or its

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Representatives that has made or delivered to the Company an Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period
Start Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, after the date hereof), and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition
Proposal or assist such Person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition Proposal
(in each case, if requested by such Person), in each case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from any material breach of Section 5.3(b); provided, however, that the Special Committee has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the
Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(c) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and provided further, however, that the Company will promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company
Group that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
Parent.
(d) No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. Except as provided by Section 5.3(e), at no time after the date hereof may the Company Board (or a
committee thereof including the Special Committee):
(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent in any
material respect; (B) adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition
Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than three separate occasions); (D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or
fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other
than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof including the Special Committee) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being
understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof including the Special Committee) may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E),
a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, none
of (1) the determination by the Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (2) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or
(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
(e) Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval:
(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of the Special Committee,
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any positive material event or
development or material change in circumstances with respect to the Company that was (A) not actually
known to, or reasonably expected by, the Special Committee or the Company Board as of the date hereof;
and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the
Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date hereof,
or changes after the date hereof in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or
the credit rating of the Company (it being understood that the underlying cause of any of the foregoing in
this clause (b) may be considered and taken into

account) (each such event, an “Intervening Event”), if the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if:
(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will specify the applicable
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and
(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its
Representatives, during such four Business Day period, must have negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Special Committee no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; or
(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during the Go-Shop
Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the Special Committee has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the Company
Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only if:
(1) the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law;
(2) the Company Group and its Representatives have complied in all material respects with their
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four Business Days in
advance (the “Notice Period”) to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, has (A) received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or “group” of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, must have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that
Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood
that the “Notice Period” in respect of such new written notice will be three Business Days); and
(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company
Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h), including
paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(f) Notice. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, within one
Business Day) notify Parent if any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute an Acquisition Proposal are
received by the Company or any of its Representatives or any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person
or “group” of Persons making such offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is prohibited
pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or “group” of Persons that is in effect
on the date of this Agreement); and (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or
proposals. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status (and
supplementally provide the terms) of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations.
(g) Certain Disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or
a committee thereof including the Special Committee) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a “stop, look and listen” communication by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof including the Special Committee) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii)
complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person
of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3; or (iv) making any disclosure to the Company
Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
Group) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof, including the Special Committee) has determined to
make in good faith in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement,
it being understood that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or a committee thereof,
including the Special Committee) pursuant to this Section 5.3(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or
any committee thereof including the Special Committee) and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3, it being
understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof including the Special Committee) to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other
than in accordance with Section 5.3(e). In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof including the Special Committee), to the extent required by law, that describes the Company’s receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in and of itself, be
deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) an
adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company Board
Recommendation Change.
(h) Breach by Representatives. The Company agrees that any breach of this Section 5.3 by any director,
officer or other Representative of the Company (other than a consultant or an employee of the Company who is
not an officer of the Company) will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company. The Company
will not authorize, direct or knowingly permit any consultant or employee of the Company to breach this Section
5.3, and upon becoming aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.3 by a consultant or
employee of the Company, shall use its reasonable best efforts to stop such breach or threatened breach.

19; provided that the Company shall consult with Parent in good faith prior to implementing any such actions by

Foreign Investment Laws, in each case as soon as practicable. If any Party or Affiliate thereof receives a request

will make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

set forth in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Parties (and their respective controlled
Affiliates, if applicable) will (i) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity

hand; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of the Buyer Parties (and their respective controlled
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand; and (ii) contest, defend
and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the

promptly notify the other Parties of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any material communication received by such Person
from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other Parties to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other parties in relation to) any
proposed draft notifications, formal notifications (provided, however, that filings made under the HSR Act need
not be shared), filing, submission or other written communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers,
presentations, correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to
a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such
submissions and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any material
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including with
respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of
any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation,
litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under applicable laws and (D) the nature and status

(whether in person, by telephone or otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Merger without giving the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the
Company and the Buyer Parties may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and any such information shall not be shared with employees,
officers or directors or their equivalents of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-
public information; provided, however, that each of the Company and the Buyer Parties may redact any
valuation and related information, or information that is protected by legal privilege, before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel” only basis.
(d) Limitation on Other Transactions. During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII and the Closing, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates (other than “portfolio companies” of Parent or such Affiliates as such term is customarily defined
in the private equity industry) will acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, by purchasing a
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by acquiring in any other manner, any business of any Person or other
business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests,
or take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
transaction would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the Merger, including by (i) imposing any
A-51
TABLE OF CONTENTS
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increasing the risk of not obtaining, any consent of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period; (ii) materially increasing the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger; or (iii) materially increasing the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise. Other than filings made in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall procure that none of Parent’s Affiliates (other than “portfolio companies” of Parent or
such Affiliates as such term is customarily defined in the private equity industry) shall make any filing pursuant
to the HSR Act that would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period or (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger or (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise.
6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings.
(a) Proxy Statement. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.3(e), the Company must include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
(b) Other Required Company Filing. If the Company determines that it is required to file any document
other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable law (such
document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company will
promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and
Nasdaq. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC
without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the
Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
Parent or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company
Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by the Buyer Parties or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time
that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
(c) Other Required Parent Filing. If Parent determines that any Buyer Party (or any of their respective
Affiliates, if applicable) is required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the
Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable law (an “Other Required Parent Filing”), then the Buyer
Parties will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent
Filing with the SEC. The Buyer Parties will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other
Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither the Buyer Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates may file
any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent will give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date
of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under
A-52
TABLE OF CONTENTS
which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Buyer
Parties with respect to any information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
any Other Required Parent Filing. The information supplied by the Buyer Parties and their respective Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will
not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.
(d) Furnishing Information. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other
hand, will furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting any information relating to the Company, the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates should
be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to
the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.
(e) Consultation Prior to Certain Communications. The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the
case may be, without first providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
written communication, and each Party will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the other Parties or their respective counsel.
(f) Notices. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will advise the other, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as
the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other
Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a
request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith.
(g) Dissemination of Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable law, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not

reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing; (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt

construed to require Parent to (i) bring any enforcement action against any source of the Equity Financing to
enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent will seek to enforce,
including by bringing suit for specific performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is
granted a decree of specific performance of the obligation to consummate the Merger); or (ii) seek the Equity
Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the

relating to the Debt Financing to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, or is within the
control, of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives.
(b) Obligations of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require the Company Group to (i) waive
or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective
Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent;

or (v) take any action that will conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable laws or
would result in a material violation or breach of, or default under, any material agreement to which any member of

its Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the
Debt Financing (other than customary representation letters, authorization letters and undertakings (including
with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy of the information
contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing based on financial information
and data derived from the Company’s historical books and records)) will be effective until the Effective Time,

arrangement, document or instrument (other than customary representation letters, authorization letters and
undertakings (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing
based on financial information and data derived from the Company’s historical books and records)) that is not
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time; and (B) any
bank information memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure reflecting the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require (1) any officer,
employee or Representative of the Company Group to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
under this Section 6.6 that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or
Representative; or (2) the Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto, effective prior
to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to be an issuer or obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time.
(c) Use of Logos. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries’ logos in
connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or likely to harm or disparage the Company Group or the reputation or goodwill of the Company Group; (ii) are
used solely in connection with a description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger; and (iii)
are used in a manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company reasonably imposes.
(d) Confidentiality. All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company or any of
its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Sources or
prospective Financing Sources and other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the
Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to
be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality
undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.
(e) Reimbursement. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any
documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the

(f) Indemnification. The Company Group and its Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless
by Parent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys’
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in
connection with any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 or the provision of information utilized in
connection therewith. Parent’s obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this Section 6.6(f) referred to
collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations.”
(g) No Exclusive Arrangements. In no event will the Guarantor, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in the Buyer Parties and the financing
sources or potential financing sources of the Buyer Parties and such investors) enter into any Contract (i)
awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive
basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in
each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company Group or in connection with the Merger.
(h) No Financing Condition. The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Except in the case of a willful and material breach that has not been
cured by the Company within a reasonable period of time after Parent has provided written notice to the
Company of the specific breach, the Company’s breach of Section 6.6(a) will not be asserted as the basis for (A)
any conditions set forth in Article VII to consummate the Merger having not been satisfied or (B) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e). If the Debt Financing has not been obtained, the
Buyer Parties will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.
6.7 Anti-Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board (and any committee empowered to take such
action, if applicable) will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that the Merger may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize or
make inapplicable the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger.
6.8 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Closing, the
Company will afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company Group, except that
the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable law or regulation requires the Company Group to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents
or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c)
access to a Contract to which the Company Group is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or information are
reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company
Group or any of its Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company Group or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company Group. Any access to the properties of the Company Group
will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the
right to perform invasive testing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
satisfy its obligations set forth above by electronic means if physical access is not permitted under applicable law or
not practicable as a result of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to
this Section 6.8 must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person designated by the
Company.

6.9 Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger,
and any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the
Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.
6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.
(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company
Group pursuant to any indemnification agreements between a member of the Company Group and any of its
current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of a member of the
Company Group prior to the Effective Time) (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) or employees for any acts
or omissions by such Indemnified Persons or employees occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, and other similar organizational documents of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation
and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date hereof. During such six-year period,
such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any adverse manner except as required
by applicable law.
(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.10(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof, each Indemnified Person from and against
any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as an Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company Group or its Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company or
the Buyer Parties with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered any of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person
delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the
claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to
control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, will be deemed to have waived any right
to object to the Indemnified Person’s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees
and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense
of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding
effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for
which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
A-59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.
(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect on the date
hereof (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms
(including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will
not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier on the date hereof. The Company may purchase a prepaid “tail” policy with respect to the
D&O Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier on the date hereof on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are no less favorable than those of the D&O Insurance so long as the
aggregate cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to
purchase such a “tail” policy, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so
long as such “tail” policy is in full force and effect.
(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.
(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail”
policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if such person were a Party. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the “tail”
policy referred to in Section 6.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter
and the Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or in
equity).
(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.
(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or
impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company Group for any of its
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.11 Employee Matters.
(a) Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change in control” (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.
(b) Existing Arrangements. Subject to this Section 6.11, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving

nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from in any way amending, modifying or terminating any such

continue to employ the employees of the Company Group as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the termination date of an applicable
Continuing Employee) (the “Continuation Period”) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide employee benefits (other than
defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, post-employment or retiree health or welfare,
change in control, retention or equity-based benefits) to each Continuing Employee that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time (subject to the same exclusions). In each case, during the Continuation Period, base compensation and
target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (other than equity or equity-based incentive
arrangements) will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee. During the Continuation Period, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits to
eligible employees in accordance with the Company’s severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on
the date hereof that have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 6.11 shall obligate the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue the
employment of any Continuing Employee for any specific period.
(d) New Plans. To the extent that a benefit plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with
the Company Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for purposes
of future vacation accrual and determining severance amounts, except that (i) such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) such service shall only be credited to
the same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited under an analogous Employee Plan, and
(iii) no service shall be required to be credited under any plan that provides for equity or equity-based, defined
benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-employment or retiree welfare benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period,
in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent
that coverage pursuant to any such plans (the “New Plan”) replaces coverage previously provided under a
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, (x) the
Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
ending on the Closing Date to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance, co-pay, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any
New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance
A-61
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following
the Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals
(except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under the Employee Plans in effect as of the date
hereof).
(e) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing
Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
continue any Employee Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement, or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.
6.12 Obligations of the Buyer Parties and the Company. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to

Parties will be jointly and severally liable for any breach of this Agreement by any Buyer Party (or, following the

Corporation) to perform and discharge any of its respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this
Agreement.

aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of the Buyer Parties to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the

Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

representation or warranty made by the Buyer Parties in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or of any failure by the Buyer Parties to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Buyer Parties set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to
the Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).
(c) Impact of Non-Compliance. The Company’s or the Buyer Parties’ failure to comply with this Section
6.13 will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether any conditions set forth in Article VII to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied or whether any termination rights set forth in Article VIII are
available.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be
required to pay more than one termination fee, collectively, or be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than
one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an
integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof, the Company will pay to Parent its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the annual
rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or
portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was actually
received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable law. All payments under this Section 8.3
shall be made by the Company to Parent (as directed by Parent) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated in Section 8.3(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (which account information may be
updated by Parent by written notice to the Company from time to time).
(e) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.
(i) Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Buyer Parties or any
of their Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter
exceed an amount equal to $156,674,686 plus the Reimbursement Obligations in the aggregate for all such
breaches (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek
or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award in
excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against (A) the Buyer Parties or the Guarantor; or (B) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than the Buyer Parties or the Guarantor), members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Buyer Parties and the
Guarantor (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”), and in no event
will the Company Group be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the
Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Guarantor or the Buyer
Parties), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions
under applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure; provided that the foregoing
shall not preclude any liability of the Financing Sources to the Company or the Buyer Parties under the
definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, nor limit the Company or the Buyer Parties from
seeking to recover any such damages or obtain equitable relief from or with respect to any Financing
Source pursuant to the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing. Other than the Guarantor’s
obligations under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the Buyer Parties’
obligations under this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than
the Guarantor and the Buyer Parties have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other
Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger.
(ii) Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent due and payable (and fully paid)
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) will be the only amount that the Buyer Parties and each of their respective
Affiliates may recover from (A) the Company Group and its Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future
holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each member of the
Company Group and its Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Company Related
Parties”) in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection
A-69
TABLE OF CONTENTS
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such
breach, termination or failure, and upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Company Related Parties
will have any further liability or obligation to the Buyer Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
any agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable);
and (2) none of the Buyer Parties or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable).
Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by the Company for breaches under
this Agreement (taking into account the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement) exceed $78,337,343 in the aggregate for all such breaches (plus any obligations pursuant to
Section 8.3(d)) (the “Company Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Parent Related Parties seek
or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to
seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess
of the Company Liability Limitation against any of the Company Related Parties, and in no event will the
Buyer Parties be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential,
special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company
Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such
breach, termination or failure.
(f) Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 8.3(e) or the existence of the Parent Liability Limitation, the Company Liability Limitation or the
availability of monetary damages, it is agreed that the Buyer Parties and the Company will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(b), except that, although the
Buyer Parties and the Company, in their respective sole discretion, may determine their choice of remedies
hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of,
Section 9.8(b), under no circumstances will the Buyer Parties or the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and any monetary damages, including,
with respect to the Buyer Parties, the Company Termination Fee.
(g) Non-Recourse Parent Party. In no event will the Company seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of
their Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery
or monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which
excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantor and the Buyer Parties) with respect to this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any
breach by the Guarantor or the Buyer Parties), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable laws arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure, other than from the Buyer Parties to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or
the Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter.
8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of the Buyer Parties and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Special Committee), except that in
the event that the Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this
Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set
forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.6, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section
9.10, Section 9.11 and this Section 8.4 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of the provisions

relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Sections 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.6, Section 9.3,
Section 9.6, Section 9.8, Section 9.9, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 or this Section 8.4) may not be amended, modified or
altered without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may, to the
extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject to the
requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement
will not constitute a waiver of such right.

or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company nor any of their Affiliates will have any rights or
claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder; provided that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall
limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under any debt commitment letter
or the definitive debt documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.
8.7 Special Committee Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Effective Time,
no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no action shall be taken by or on behalf of the
Company under or with respect to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Special Committee.

disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Buyer Parties or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of
their respective Affiliates; or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing, it being
understood that, in each case, such assignment will not (i) affect the obligations of the parties to the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and Company
Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon
and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by
any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.
9.4 Confidentiality. The Buyer Parties and the Company hereby acknowledge that Vista Equity Partners
Management, LLC and the Company have previously executed that certain Confidentiality Agreement set forth on
Section 9.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), that will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms; provided that from and after the date hereof, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, no consent of the Company shall be required for any Person who is a
potential source of, or may provide, equity, debt or any other type of financing for the transactions contemplated
hereby to become a Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of Vista Equity Partners
Management, LLC thereunder. Each of the Buyer Parties and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all
documents and information concerning the Company Group furnished or made available to the Buyer Parties or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By
executing this Agreement, each of the Buyer Parties agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.
9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of
this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on
which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties
thereto.
9.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and
will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by
Section 6.10; (b) if a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to grant specific performance and has instead
granted an award of damages, then the Company may enforce such award and seek additional damages on behalf of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (which the Buyer Parties and the
Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); (c) if any of the Buyer Parties wrongfully terminate or willfully breach
this Agreement, or if the Guarantor wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the Guarantee, then, following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company may seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (which the Buyer Parties and the
Guarantor acknowledge and agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i); and (d) from and after the Closing, the rights of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, to receive the consideration set forth in Article II. The rights
granted pursuant to clause (c) of the second sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards by the Company, in its sole and absolute
discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will
attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, and subsequently transfer
therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with
respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3(e)(i)) may, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed,
A-73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by
the Company for the use and benefit of the Company Group in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(e), Section 8.4, Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.8, Section 9.9,
Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and this Section 9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors
and assigns, each of whom is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof (it being understood and agreed that
the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns) and Section 8.3(g) will inure to the benefit of each Non-Recourse Parent Party and its successors and
assigns, each of whom is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof (it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of such Section will be enforceable by each Non-Recourse Parent Party and its successors and assigns).
9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect, and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.
9.8 Remedies.
(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and monetary
damages, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance).
(b) Specific Performance.
(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do
not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and
(C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the
Company nor the Buyer Parties would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing the Buyer Parties’ obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely
completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the definitive agreements
for any Debt Financing under the terms thereof, none of the Company and its Affiliates and their direct and
indirect equityholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against
any Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the
Debt Financing, and in no event shall the Company, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect
equityholders be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any
Financing Source.
A-74
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand; and (B) the specific
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Buyer Parties pursuant to
this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or any other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy
at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.
9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware. Any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or other rules that would
result in the application of the laws or statutes of limitations of a different jurisdiction.
9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.
(a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process (whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in
any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Guarantee, for and on behalf of itself or any of its
properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware (and any appellate court therefrom) or, if any federal court within the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State of Delaware (and any appellate court
therefrom)) (the “Chosen Courts”) in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement,
the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection

Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi)
agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the Buyer Parties and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.
(b) Jurisdiction for Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any
appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or
support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent
A-75

section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that
are set forth in the corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this

and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

The Board of Directors
Duck Creek Technologies, Inc.
22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10
Boston, MA 02210
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Duck Creek Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the
“Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly owned subsidiary of Disco Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), among the Company,
the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Disco Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), the Company will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other
than shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or owned by
the Acquiror, Merger Sub and any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and Dissenting Company
Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $19.00 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft dated January 8, 2023 of the Agreement;
(ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries
in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such
companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available
information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market
prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed
certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its
business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we
deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to
certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial
condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or
appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us.
We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our
engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor
have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived
therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such
analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and that
the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also
assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, the Acquiror and Merger Sub in the
Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are
not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common
Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in
connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express
no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any
party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a
fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed
Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of
our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or
investment banking relationships with the Company, for which we and such affiliates have received customary
compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead bookrunning manager on an
offering of the Company’s equity securities in January 2021 and joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a credit facility
for the Company in October 2021. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have
also had commercial or investment banking relationships with Accenture plc (“Accenture”), the Company’s 15.9%
shareholder, for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such
period have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a credit facility for Accenture in April 2021.
During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have also had commercial or investment
banking relationships with portfolio companies of Apax Partners LLP (“Apax”), the Company’s 23.8% shareholder, for
which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have
included providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to Apax
portfolio companies. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding
credit facilities of Apax portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.
During the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our affiliates have had any other material
financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Acquiror. During the two
years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships
with Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Acquiror (“Vista”), and Vista portfolio companies, for
which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Our commercial banking affiliate is an
administrative agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of Vista, for which it receives customary
compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, during the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and
our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with Vista portfolio companies for which we
and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included
providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and financial advisory services to portfolio
companies of Vista. Our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities
of Vista portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we
and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and
Accenture. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company,
Accenture, Apax portfolio companies or Vista portfolio companies for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial
instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the consideration to be
paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.
This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for
the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or

any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third
party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in
any proxy or information statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed
publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.

The Special Committee of the Board of Directors
Duck Creek Technologies, Inc.
22 Boston Wharf Road, Floor 10
Boston, MA 02210
 
Members of the Special Committee:
We understand that Duck Creek Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Disco Parent, LLC (“Parent”) and Disco Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company and the Company will be the surviving company in such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (“Company Common Stock”), other than shares held by the Company and its subsidiaries, by Parent or
Merger Sub or by any of their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (“Owned Company Shares”) or Dissenting
Company Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $19.00
per share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the
Merger Agreement.
The Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”) has asked us whether, in our opinion,
the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that
we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company, including certain net
operating loss carryforwards of the Company, prepared and furnished to us by management of the
Company, as approved for our use by the Special Committee and the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company and the Special Committee their assessment of the
past and current operations of the Company, the current financial condition and prospects of the
Company, and the Forecasts;
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with
those of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the
Merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that
we deemed relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated January 8, 2023, of the Merger
Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed
appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available
to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent verification of such information (and
B-2-1

have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further
relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed with
your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
good faith judgments of management of the Company and the Special Committee as to the future financial
performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Forecasts or the
assumptions on which they are based.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the
final executed Merger Agreement will not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the
representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party
will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have
further assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents,
approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation,
restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or
reduce the contemplated benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger. As you are aware, the
credit, financial and stock markets have been experiencing unusual volatility and we express no opinion or view as to
any potential effects of such volatility on the parties or the Merger.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made
or assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been
furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company
under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this
opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the
fairness to the holders of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration.
We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or
any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative
to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without
limitation, the structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our
opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that
might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage
in the Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in
respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should vote or act in
respect of the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company Common
Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the
Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability
of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts
and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee
for our services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to
indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date
hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services
to the Company and we have not received any compensation from the Company during such period. During the two
year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services
to Vista Equity Partners Management, LLC (“Sponsor”), an affiliate of Parent, and its affiliates and portfolio
companies for which we have received fees. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group
L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services regarding matters unrelated to the Company to
Apax Partners (“Apax”), an affiliate of which owns more than 5% of the Company Common Stock, and its affiliates
and portfolio companies. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates
have not provided financial advisory services to Accenture LLP and Accenture Holdings BV (“Accenture”), which
owns more than 5% of the Company Common Stock. We may provide financial advisory or other services to the
Company, Sponsor, Apax, Accenture or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio companies in the future, and in
connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and
the accounts of customers, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research,
private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In connection with these businesses or
otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as investment
funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short
positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt
or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial instruments of or relating to the
Company, Sponsor, Apax, Accenture or potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates or
portfolio companies or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Sponsor, Apax,
Accenture or any of their respective affiliates or portfolio companies.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Special
Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of this
opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party
for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval, except the Company may reproduce this opinion
in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and required to
be mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration
to be received by holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.
