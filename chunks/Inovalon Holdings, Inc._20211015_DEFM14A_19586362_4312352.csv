The summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement set forth below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important
to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Such
information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or, in the case of the Company, in the public filings that the Company makes with the SEC,
which are available without charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. For additional information, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find
More Information.”
The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified
and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is
important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and were
negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the
Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in some
cases were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by the Company, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. The
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement will not survive completion of the Merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter
of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the
Merger Agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may or may not have been included in the
Company’s periodic and current reports, this proxy statement and other documents filed with the SEC. For the foregoing reasons, the representations,
warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information

Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the Special Committee; Fairness

Committee held on August 18, 2021, unanimously recommended that the Company Board approve the execution by the Company of
definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. In evaluating

Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) held on
August 18, 2021, unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Nordic Capital X, the
Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) declared that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders that the Company enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger and all of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommended that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the

unanimously approved, consistent with the Company’s Audit Committee Charter and applicable NASDAQ listing rules, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as a proposed transaction between the Company and a related party. In
evaluating the Merger, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) also consulted with the Company’s
management, legal and other advisors and considered various material factors.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger
Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

as of August 19, 2021 and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor
•
The Special Committee retained Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special
Committee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be
received by the Public Stockholders. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on August 18, 2021, Evercore rendered to the
Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the
Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.
•
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated August 18, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in
rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company
encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the

Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the
Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger.
Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that

Merger.

•
Purpose and Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger; Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the Fairness of the
Merger. Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders, including Dr. Dunleavy, through
certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their
purposes and reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders. For a description of the Rollover Stockholders’ purposes and reasons
for the Merger, and their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Purpose and
Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the
Fairness of the Merger.”
•
Certain Effects of the Merger; Treatment of the Shares. At the time at which the Merger becomes effective, being the time at which a
certificate of merger substantially in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the “Certificate of Merger”) is filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time and date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties to the
Merger Agreement and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company Class B Common Stock (the “Shares” and, each, a “Share”) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding a portion of the Shares held by the Rollover Stockholders, including certain
Shares held by Dr. Dunleavy and certain of his affiliates and certain holders of Company Class B Common Stock, that will, pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements, each dated August 19, 2021, separately entered in by the Rollover Stockholders and Parent, as they may be
amended from time to time (the “Rollover Agreements”), be exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc., which in turn will be
exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Rollover Shares”), Shares held by Parent or
Merger Sub (or any of their respective subsidiaries) or in the treasury of the Company (“Cancelled Shares”) and Shares that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not been voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and whose holders properly exercise and validly perfect appraisal rights with respect to
such Shares in accordance with, and who comply with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
2
Table of Contents
Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to be
outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement. For further information about the treatment of the Shares, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects of the Merger —
Treatment of the Shares.”
•
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a “Company Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an
amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be cancelled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Each award of restricted stock units, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (a
“Company RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Each Cash-Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and
terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS
Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of performance). For the purpose of the
Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, a “Cash-Out Company RS Award” means (a) with respect to Company RS Awards
held by an employee that has signed a release prior to the Closing Date, 30% of any unvested portion of such employee’s
Company RS Award, and (b) with respect to Company RS Awards held by any other person, none of the unvested portion of
such employee’s Company RS Award; and “Company RS Award” means an award of restricted shares of Company Common
Stock that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (including performance-vesting conditions).
•
Each Conversion Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a
cash-based retention award in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to
the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and
requirements). For the purposes of the Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, “Conversion Company RS Award” means
any Company RS Award that is not a Cash-Out Company RS Award.
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the
Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the Inovalon 2015 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”), each participant’s outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate
on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP)
and the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For a further description of the treatment of equity compensation awards, See “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity
Compensation Awards” and “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
•
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers have informed us
that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares
3
Table of Contents
owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13,
2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our stockholders, our directors and executive
officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740 shares of Company
Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. For a further description of the voting intentions of the Company’s directors and executive officers, see
“Special Factors — Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Information about the Special
Meeting — Voting Intentions of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers.”
•
Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting
power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own
approximately 23% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have separately entered into support agreements
with Parent, each dated August 19, 2021, as they may be amended from time to time (the “Support Agreements”), pursuant to which the
Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. However, the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement separately requires an affirmative vote of Public Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, which excludes all shares of Company Common Stock held by Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital. Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy
statement.
•
Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
for US federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-US tax laws. A US Holder who solely receives
cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
Stockholders who are Non-US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) will generally not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless such Non-
US Holder has certain connections to the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on
the stockholder’s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them (including the application of any US federal non-income, state, local and non-US tax laws) of the Merger. For
further information about the material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Material US
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
•
Financing of the Merger. The Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent estimates that the total funds necessary to
complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $7,500,000,000. Parent expects this amount to be funded via
approximately $3,175,000,000 from equity investments by Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-RAIF, acting through and represented by
its managing general partner Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL for and on behalf of its compartment Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-

$1,300,000,000 from the Rollover Stockholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreements.
•
Parent has delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of August 19, 2021, entered into by and among Parent and

the terms and conditions contained therein, to

provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $3,175,000,000 to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) in connection with the funding of the
transaction. The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter (if and only if
the Company is entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligations to consummate the Merger) solely for the purpose of seeking
specific performance of Parent’s right to cause the Equity Commitment to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter (solely to the extent that Parent can cause the commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter). For further information about the financing of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”
•
Blackstone Credit (together with funds and accounts managed or advised by it or its affiliates), Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC
(together with its affiliates and its and their managed funds and accounts), Apollo Global Funding, LLC and Apollo Capital
Management, L.P., on behalf of one or more investment funds, separate accounts and other entities owned (in whole or in part),
controlled, managed and/or advised by it or its affiliates (the “Debt Commitment Parties”) have agreed to provide Parent with debt
financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,000,000,000 on the terms set forth in the debt commitment letter, dated August
19, 2021, executed by the Commitment Parties and accepted by Parent (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligations of the
Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary terms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and certain other customary closing conditions. Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt
financing, the failure of Parent to obtain sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case,
Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee. For further information about the financing of the Merger, see
“Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”
•
Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a Limited
Guarantee, dated as of August 19, 2021 (the “Limited Guarantee”), entered into by Nordic Capital X, 22C Capital I, L.P., 22C Capital I-A,
L.P., Insight Partners XII, L.P., Insight Partners (Cayman) XII, L.P., Insight Partners (Delaware) XII, L.P., Insight Partners (EU) XII, S.C.Sp,

XII Buyout Annex Fund, S.C.Sp, Insight Partners XII Buyout Annex Fund (Co-Investors) (B), L.P. and Ashburton Investment Pte. Ltd.
(each, a “Guarantor” and, collectively, the “Guarantors”) in favor of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guarantee and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Guarantors has agreed to guarantee Parent’s obligations under the Merger
Agreement, capped at $376,305,000, with respect to payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain interest payments and
reimbursement obligations of Parent set forth in the Merger Agreement. For a further description of the Limited Guarantee, see “Special
Factors — Limited Guarantee.”
•
Regulatory Approvals. The Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any successor statute, rules or regulations thereto (the “HSR Act”),
which prevents the parties from completing the Merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. In addition, the Merger is subject to clearance of the Merger by the Committee of
Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which requires that the parties file a declaration and furnish information to CFIUS in
accordance with the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.§ 4565), and its implementing regulations located at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800-
802 (the “CFIUS Authorities”) and receive CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the Merger Agreement). For further information about the
regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger, see “Special Factors — Regulatory Approvals.” Although we expect that all
required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be
timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the Merger not being
satisfied.

•
Litigation Relating to the Merger. Lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Company Board or the Company’s officers in
connection with the Merger, which could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company,

Agreement), and the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Special Committee

to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations

discussions and negotiations with such Third Party in respect of the Acquisition Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board and the Special Committee, as applicable, are prohibited from taking certain actions enumerated in the Merger

Approval, (i) there occurs an Intervening Event or the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial
Advisor) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; (ii) the Company Board (or Special Committee, if applicable) provides Parent with at least three (3) Business Days’
advance written notice that the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company has negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that an
Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary; and (iii) after giving effect to clause (ii), as required, the Company
Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor) that the failure to effect and Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the Special Meeting, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be
important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to the “Summary Term Sheet” and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in
this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, all of which
you should read carefully in their entirety. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q.
Why am I receiving this document?
A.
On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation
surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.” Parent and Merger Sub are entities that are
affiliated with a consortium of private equity investors led by Nordic Capital X. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A
and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself): (i)
determined and declared that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair, advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and the Public Stockholders and recommended the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Inovalon
stockholders, subject to certain terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the terms and conditions
thereof and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and
the Rollover Agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In evaluating the Merger, the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and Special Committee also consulted with the Company’s management, legal and
other advisors (including, in the case of the Special Committee, Evercore) and considered various material factors.
The Company is holding the Special Meeting so that the Inovalon stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Golden
Parachute Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company is soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting. You are receiving this proxy statement because you own Shares. This proxy statement
contains important information about the Merger and the Special Meeting, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed proxy card allows you to
vote your Shares without attending the Special Meeting.
Your vote is extremely important, and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. For more information on how to vote your
Shares, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Information about the Special Meeting.”
Q.
What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?
A.
The proposed transaction is the Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In addition, following completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time and in compliance with Applicable Law, the Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), upon application to the SEC. As a result of the Merger, the Company will no longer be an
independent public company, the Shares will no longer be listed on any exchange or quotation system, price quotations will no longer be available
and the Company’s registration and reporting obligation under the Exchange Act will cease.
12
Table of Contents
Following completion of the Merger, your Shares will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and you will no longer have any interest in the Company’s future earnings, growth or
value.
For more information about the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, see “The Merger Agreement.”
Q.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A.
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third
party, the Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the
Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management
will operate the Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the Company’s stockholders will
continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent that the current
market price of Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. For more information about what happens if the Merger is
not completed, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed.”
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs and, under certain circumstances, reimburse up to $10,000,000 of Parent’s out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs. For more information about termination fees, see “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”

Q.
What is the difference between being a “stockholder of record” and a “beneficial owner” of Shares held in “street name”?

Table of Contents
and proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly
to us or to vote by attending the Special Meeting virtually.

that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those Shares,
the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your Shares
by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting virtually. However, since you are not the stockholder
of record, you may not vote these Shares electronically at the virtual Special Meeting unless you provide a legal proxy from your broker, bank or

Background of the Merger. For a description of the background of the Merger, including our discussions with Nordic Capital X, see
“Special Factors — Background of the Merger.”
•
Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the Special Committee; Fairness
of the Merger. After careful consideration, the Special Committee, pursuant to resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Special
Committee held on August 18, 2021, unanimously recommended that the Company Board approve the execution by the Company of
definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. In evaluating
the Merger, the Special Committee consulted with the Company’s management and the Special Committee’s independent legal and
financial advisors and considered various material factors.
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) held on
August 18, 2021, unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Nordic Capital X, the
Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) declared that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders that the Company enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger and all of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iii) recommended that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the
adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement. At the same meeting, the members of the Audit Committee of the Company Board
unanimously approved, consistent with the Company’s Audit Committee Charter and applicable NASDAQ listing rules, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as a proposed transaction between the Company and a related party. In
evaluating the Merger, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) also consulted with the Company’s
management, legal and other advisors and considered various material factors.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger
Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor
•
The Special Committee retained Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special
Committee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be
received by the Public Stockholders. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on August 18, 2021, Evercore rendered to the
Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the
Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.
•
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated August 18, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures

Merger.

•
Purpose and Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger; Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the Fairness of the
Merger. Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders, including Dr. Dunleavy, through
certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their
purposes and reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders. For a description of the Rollover Stockholders’ purposes and reasons
for the Merger, and their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Purpose and
Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the
Fairness of the Merger.”
•
Certain Effects of the Merger; Treatment of the Shares. At the time at which the Merger becomes effective, being the time at which a
certificate of merger substantially in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the “Certificate of Merger”) is filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time and date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties to the
Merger Agreement and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company Class B Common Stock (the “Shares” and, each, a “Share”) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding a portion of the Shares held by the Rollover Stockholders, including certain
Shares held by Dr. Dunleavy and certain of his affiliates and certain holders of Company Class B Common Stock, that will, pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements, each dated August 19, 2021, separately entered in by the Rollover Stockholders and Parent, as they may be
amended from time to time (the “Rollover Agreements”), be exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc., which in turn will be
exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Rollover Shares”), Shares held by Parent or
Merger Sub (or any of their respective subsidiaries) or in the treasury of the Company (“Cancelled Shares”) and Shares that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not been voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and whose holders properly exercise and validly perfect appraisal rights with respect to
such Shares in accordance with, and who comply with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
2
Table of Contents
Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to be
outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement. For further information about the treatment of the Shares, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects of the Merger —
Treatment of the Shares.”
•
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a “Company Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an
amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be cancelled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Each award of restricted stock units, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (a
“Company RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Each Cash-Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and
terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS
Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of performance). For the purpose of the
Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, a “Cash-Out Company RS Award” means (a) with respect to Company RS Awards
held by an employee that has signed a release prior to the Closing Date, 30% of any unvested portion of such employee’s
Company RS Award, and (b) with respect to Company RS Awards held by any other person, none of the unvested portion of
such employee’s Company RS Award; and “Company RS Award” means an award of restricted shares of Company Common
Stock that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (including performance-vesting conditions).
•
Each Conversion Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a
cash-based retention award in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to
the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and
requirements). For the purposes of the Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, “Conversion Company RS Award” means
any Company RS Award that is not a Cash-Out Company RS Award.
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the
Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the Inovalon 2015 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”), each participant’s outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate
on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP)
and the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For a further description of the treatment of equity compensation awards, See “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity
Compensation Awards” and “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
•
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers have informed us
that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares
3
Table of Contents
owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13,
2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our stockholders, our directors and executive
officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740 shares of Company
Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. For a further description of the voting intentions of the Company’s directors and executive officers, see
“Special Factors — Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Information about the Special
Meeting — Voting Intentions of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers.”
•
Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting
power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own
approximately 23% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have separately entered into support agreements
with Parent, each dated August 19, 2021, as they may be amended from time to time (the “Support Agreements”), pursuant to which the
Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. However, the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement separately requires an affirmative vote of Public Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, which excludes all shares of Company Common Stock held by Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital. Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy
statement.
•
Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
for US federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-US tax laws. A US Holder who solely receives
cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
Stockholders who are Non-US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) will generally not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless such Non-
US Holder has certain connections to the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on
the stockholder’s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them (including the application of any US federal non-income, state, local and non-US tax laws) of the Merger. For
further information about the material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Material US
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
•
Financing of the Merger. The Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent estimates that the total funds necessary to
complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $7,500,000,000. Parent expects this amount to be funded via
approximately $3,175,000,000 from equity investments by Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-RAIF, acting through and represented by
its managing general partner Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL for and on behalf of its compartment Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-

$1,300,000,000 from the Rollover Stockholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreements.
•
Parent has delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of August 19, 2021, entered into by and among Parent and

provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $3,175,000,000 to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) in connection with the funding of the
transaction. The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter (if and only if
the Company is entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligations to consummate the Merger) solely for the purpose of seeking
specific performance of Parent’s right to cause the Equity Commitment to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter (solely to the extent that Parent can cause the commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter). For further information about the financing of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”
•
Blackstone Credit (together with funds and accounts managed or advised by it or its affiliates), Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC
(together with its affiliates and its and their managed funds and accounts), Apollo Global Funding, LLC and Apollo Capital
Management, L.P., on behalf of one or more investment funds, separate accounts and other entities owned (in whole or in part),
controlled, managed and/or advised by it or its affiliates (the “Debt Commitment Parties”) have agreed to provide Parent with debt
financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,000,000,000 on the terms set forth in the debt commitment letter, dated August
19, 2021, executed by the Commitment Parties and accepted by Parent (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligations of the
Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary terms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and certain other customary closing conditions. Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt
financing, the failure of Parent to obtain sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case,
Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee. For further information about the financing of the Merger, see
“Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”
•
Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a Limited
Guarantee, dated as of August 19, 2021 (the “Limited Guarantee”), entered into by Nordic Capital X, 22C Capital I, L.P., 22C Capital I-A,

XII Buyout Annex Fund, S.C.Sp, Insight Partners XII Buyout Annex Fund (Co-Investors) (B), L.P. and Ashburton Investment Pte. Ltd.
(each, a “Guarantor” and, collectively, the “Guarantors”) in favor of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Guarantee and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Guarantors has agreed to guarantee Parent’s obligations under the Merger
Agreement, capped at $376,305,000, with respect to payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain interest payments and
reimbursement obligations of Parent set forth in the Merger Agreement. For a further description of the Limited Guarantee, see “Special
Factors — Limited Guarantee.”
•
Regulatory Approvals. The Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any successor statute, rules or regulations thereto (the “HSR Act”),
which prevents the parties from completing the Merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. In addition, the Merger is subject to clearance of the Merger by the Committee of
Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which requires that the parties file a declaration and furnish information to CFIUS in
accordance with the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.§ 4565), and its implementing regulations located at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800-
802 (the “CFIUS Authorities”) and receive CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the Merger Agreement). For further information about the
regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger, see “Special Factors — Regulatory Approvals.” Although we expect that all
required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be
timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the Merger not being
satisfied.

Litigation Relating to the Merger. Lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Company Board or the Company’s officers in
connection with the Merger, which could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company,

agree to do any of the foregoing.
If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal after August 19, 2021 and before the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval (which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement), and the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to (A) furnish non-public information, and afford access
to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations
with such Third Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal, in each case, would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may furnish certain non-public information to and engage in
discussions and negotiations with such Third Party in respect of the Acquisition Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board and the Special Committee, as applicable, are prohibited from taking certain actions enumerated in the Merger
Agreement that would constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change unless, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) there occurs an Intervening Event or the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial
Advisor) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; (ii) the Company Board (or Special Committee, if applicable) provides Parent with at least three (3) Business Days’
advance written notice that the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company has negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that an
Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary; and (iii) after giving effect to clause (ii), as required, the Company
Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor) that the failure to effect and Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS AND THE SPECIAL MEETING
The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the Special Meeting, the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be
important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to the “Summary Term Sheet” and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in
this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, all of which
you should read carefully in their entirety. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q.
Why am I receiving this document?
A.
On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation
surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.” Parent and Merger Sub are entities that are
affiliated with a consortium of private equity investors led by Nordic Capital X. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A
and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself): (i)
determined and declared that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair, advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and the Public Stockholders and recommended the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Inovalon
stockholders, subject to certain terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the terms and conditions
thereof and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and
the Rollover Agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In evaluating the Merger, the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and Special Committee also consulted with the Company’s management, legal and
other advisors (including, in the case of the Special Committee, Evercore) and considered various material factors.
The Company is holding the Special Meeting so that the Inovalon stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Golden
Parachute Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company is soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting. You are receiving this proxy statement because you own Shares. This proxy statement
contains important information about the Merger and the Special Meeting, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed proxy card allows you to
vote your Shares without attending the Special Meeting.
Your vote is extremely important, and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. For more information on how to vote your
Shares, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Information about the Special Meeting.”
Q.
What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?
A.
The proposed transaction is the Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In addition, following completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time and in compliance with Applicable Law, the Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), upon application to the SEC. As a result of the Merger, the Company will no longer be an
independent public company, the Shares will no longer be listed on any exchange or quotation system, price quotations will no longer be available
and the Company’s registration and reporting obligation under the Exchange Act will cease.
12
Table of Contents
Following completion of the Merger, your Shares will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and you will no longer have any interest in the Company’s future earnings, growth or
value.
For more information about the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, see “The Merger Agreement.”
Q.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A.
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third
party, the Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the
Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management
will operate the Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the Company’s stockholders will
continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent that the current
market price of Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. For more information about what happens if the Merger is
not completed, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed.”
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs and, under certain circumstances, reimburse up to $10,000,000 of Parent’s out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs. For more information about termination fees, see “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”

to us or to vote by attending the Special Meeting virtually.
If your Shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those Shares held in “street name.” In
that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those Shares,
the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your Shares

voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, separately entered into Support Agreements with Parent.
Under the Support Agreements, the Rollover Stockholders agreed to vote their Shares in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Support Agreement. The obligations of the Rollover Stockholders under the Support Agreements will automatically terminate upon the earliest to
occur of: (i) the mutual agreement of the parties thereto to terminate the applicable Support Agreement; (ii) the End Date; (iii) the Effective Time;
and (iv) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In the event the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change, in compliance with the Merger Agreement, prior to the Company’s receipt
of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the obligation of the Rollover Stockholders to vote the Shares listed in the Support Agreements
as described above will be modified such that the Rollover Stockholders will each have the right to so vote (x) in favor of the Merger or (y) such
proportion of Shares as votes cast by the Inovalon stockholders other than the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as
applicable, with respect to the applicable matter (such proportion determined without the inclusion of the votes cast by the Dunleavy Entities, Mr.
André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as applicable).
Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the proxy statement and are incorporated by reference in the proxy statement in its
entirety. For more information about the voting intentions of the Rollover Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Intent of the Rollover
Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Special Factors — Support Agreement.”
Q.
How do I vote?
A.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date, you may vote your Shares on matters presented at the Special Meeting in any of the
following ways:
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually and casting your vote electronically;
•
by proxy (stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy);
•
on the Internet, by following the Internet proxy instructions printed on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone, using the telephone number printed on the enclosed proxy card; or
•
by mail, by marking the enclosed proxy card, dating and signing it, and returning it in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive
instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your Shares voted. Those instructions will identify
which of the above choices are available to you in order to have your Shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote
electronically by attending the Special Meeting virtually, you must have a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee naming you as the
proxy. You should allow yourself enough time prior to the Special Meeting to obtain this proxy from the holder of record.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a proxy for your Shares, and to confirm
that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone in advance of the Special
Meeting.
Please refer to the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form to determine the deadlines for submitting a proxy over the Internet or
by telephone in advance of the Special Meeting. If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card must be received by
our Corporate Secretary by the time the Special Meeting begins.

Q.
What is a proxy?
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your Shares. This written document describing the matters to be considered and voted
on at the Special Meeting is called a proxy statement. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your Shares is called a proxy card. For more
information about voting by proxy, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”
Q.
If I am a stockholder of record, what happens if I do not vote or submit a proxy card?
A.
If you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either electronically at the virtual Special Meeting or by proxy, your Shares will not be
voted at the Special Meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Additionally, if you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, electronically at the virtual Special Meeting or by proxy, your failure to vote
will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, with respect to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative
vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of Inovalon’s outstanding common stock, voting as a single class; (ii) a majority of outstanding
Company Class A Common Stock; (iii) a majority of outstanding Class B Common Stock; and (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding
common stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public Stockholders; and (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as a
quorum is present) or the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present). For more information, see “Information about the
Special Meeting.”
Q.
If my Shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my Shares for me?
A.
Your broker, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Shares if you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote.
You should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding the voting of your Shares. Under applicable stock
exchange rules, absent your instructions, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on “non-routine” matters
and all of the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting are, under such rules, “non-routine.” As a result, absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of such Shares, your broker, bank or other nominee is not empowered to vote such Shares.
If you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on at least one, but not all of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting,
your Shares will be voted according to your instructions on those proposals for which you have provided instructions and will be counted as
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. In this scenario, a “broker non-vote” will occur with
respect to each other proposal for which you did not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.
A failure to provide instructions with respect to any of the proposals or a broker non-vote will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval thresholds requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding Company Common Stock; (ii) a majority of outstanding Company Class A Common Stock; (iii) a majority of outstanding Company
Class B Common Stock; or (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public
Stockholders; (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal; and (c) have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a
quorum is present). For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — Voting.”
Q.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the Shares voted?
A.
If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit a proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, and each of them,
with full power of substitution, will vote your Shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes or
the proxy card, you may specify whether your Shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or to “ABSTAIN” from voting on, all, some or none
of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly execute your proxy card but do not mark the boxes indicating how your Shares should be voted on a matter, the Shares represented
by your properly executed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal and “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal. For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”

Q.
Can I change or revoke my vote?
A.
Yes. You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised, by (i)
submitting another proxy, including a proxy card, at a later date by telephone or on the Internet or by timely delivery of a validly executed, later-
dated proxy; (ii) giving written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, which must be filed with our Corporate Secretary before the Special
Meeting begins; or (iii) attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically. If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of
Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, please refer to the information forwarded by your broker, bank or other
nominee for procedures on revoking your proxy.
Only your last submitted proxy will be considered. Please cast your vote “FOR” each of the proposals, following the instructions set forth on your
enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, as promptly as possible. For more information, see
“Information about the Special Meeting — Proxies and Revocation.”
Q.
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A.
If, as of the Record Date, you hold Shares as the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name,” or through more than one broker, bank or other
nominee, and also directly as the stockholder of record or otherwise, you may receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction forms relating
to the Special Meeting. These should each be executed and returned separately in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy
statement in order to ensure that all of your Shares are voted.
Q.
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A.
No. After the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with detailed written instructions for exchanging your Shares for the
Merger Consideration. If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other
nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of
your Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in your certificates now.
Q.
What happens if I sell my Shares before the Special Meeting?
A.
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is prior to both the date of the Special Meeting and the consummation of
the Merger. If you transfer your Shares before the Record Date, you will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and will not be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. If you transfer your Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting you will, unless special
arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting, but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person
to whom you transfer your Shares. Unless special arrangements are made, the person to whom you transfer your Shares after the Record Date will
not have a right to vote those Shares at the Special Meeting. For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”
Q.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A.
The Company has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. The Company has agreed to
pay MacKenzie Partners, Inc. a fee of approximately $50,000 – $75,000, and to reimburse MacKenzie Partners, Inc. for certain out-of-pocket fees,
charges and expenses. The Company will indemnify MacKenzie Partners, Inc. and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and
expenses. The Company also will reimburse brokers, banks, other nominees, custodians and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of the
Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of our Shares and in obtaining voting instructions from those
owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, over the Internet or in person. Our
directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies. For more information, see “Information about the
Special Meeting — Solicitation of Proxies; Payment of Solicitation Expenses.”
Q.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A.
The SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers, banks and other nominees to satisfy delivery requirements with respect to two
or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement.
18
Table of Contents
This process is commonly referred to as “householding” and can result in significant cost savings for the Company. To take advantage of this
opportunity, the Company, brokers, banks and other nominees who hold your Shares may deliver only one proxy statement to multiple stockholders
who share an address unless one or more of the stockholders has provided contrary instructions. The Company will deliver promptly, upon written
or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.
For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — Householding of the Proxy Statement.”
Q:
What rights do I have to seek an appraisal of my Shares?
A.
Each holder of Shares will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of such holder’s Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, but only if such holder does not vote such Shares in favor of a Merger Agreement Proposal and otherwise complies with the statutory
requirements and procedures for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which is the appraisal rights
statute applicable to Delaware corporations. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements and procedures will result in the loss of
appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex F to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
The requirements and procedures are also summarized in this proxy statement. For more information about appraisal rights, see “Information about
the Special Meeting — Dissenters’ Rights” and Annex F to this proxy statement.
Q.
What are the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a US Holder?
A.
If you are a US Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), receipt of cash in
exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. Generally, you will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your Shares. However, the tax
consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how
the Merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section below “Special Factors — Material
US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q.
What are the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a Non-US Holder?
A.
If you are a Non-US Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), you
generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless you have certain connections to
the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your
own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
below “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

SPECIAL FACTORS
The following, together with the summary of the Merger Agreement set forth under the section titled “The Merger Agreement,” is a description of
the material aspects of the Merger. While we believe that the following description covers the material aspects of the Merger, the description may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire document, including the Merger Agreement
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the Merger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to, the Merger Agreement. You may obtain additional information without charge as described in the section titled “Where You
Can Find More Information.”
We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, the holders of Shares
(other than the holders of Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) will have the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $41.00 per share of Company Common Stock in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest, subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement."""

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not
purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Special Committee, the Company Board, the Company’s representatives, Nordic
Capital X, Nordic Capital X’s representatives and advisors, and other parties. Other than as described below, there have been no material contacts
between the Company and Nordic Capital X in the past two years.
The Company Board, together with the Company’s management and with the assistance of the Company’s advisors, has periodically reviewed and
assessed the Company’s operations, financial performance, competitive position, and growth opportunities in the context of the Company’s long-term
strategic goals and plans. The Company Board, together with the Company’s management, regularly reviews potential opportunities to enhance
stockholder value and considers various strategic alternatives.
Beginning in September 2019, the Company Board, together with the Company’s management, commenced a detailed strategic review that included
an assessment of the Company’s operations, financial performance, leverage profile, competitive position, new product innovation opportunities, and
long-term plans and an exploration of potential opportunities to further strengthen the Company’s market position and enhance stockholder value,
including various alternatives to help achieve its plans such as raising equity or convertible debt, refinancing existing debt, add-on acquisitions, joint
ventures, collaborations and business combinations. In connection with this strategic review, the Company Board was briefed on contacts from various
potential strategic partners and the ensuing discussions of potential future opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships, but
none of these discussions led to any specific proposals.
In connection with this strategic review and as part of the Company Board’s ongoing governance and review practices, the Nominating &
Corporate Governance Committee of the Company Board sought advice from outside counsel regarding fiduciary duties of directors, appropriate
approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a director is a large stockholder, including the
circumstances in which it would be prudent to form a special committee of independent directors. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee
requested that outside counsel prepare a memorandum summarizing its advice, which was presented and discussed extensively at the regularly-
scheduled meeting of the Company Board on June 17, 2020.
On August 27, 2020, the management presented to the Company Board an overview of the Company’s capital structure, which included a
discussion of potential sources of strategic capital and other methods to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. The Company Board
instructed management to continue its review of sources of strategic capital and strategies for helping the Company to further accelerate and expand the
achievement of its corporate objectives and mission.
On November 11, 2020, a Managing Partner at a private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm A”) contacted Keith R. Dunleavy, the Company’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, via e-mail to inquire about whether the Company would be interested in a potential transaction between PE Firm A
and the Company. On December 2, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy held a videoconference with representatives of PE Firm A to discuss PE Firm A’s expression of
interest. Following this telephone conference, on December 4, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy informed William L. Teuber, Jr., the current lead independent director of
the
21
Table of Contents
Company Board, of PE Firm A’s indication of interest and informed Mr. Teuber that he would keep him and the Company Board informed of future
developments with respect to PE Firm A. Following the December 2 discussion, there were no further communications between PE Firm A and the
Company, its management or the Company Board until May 2021 (as described below).
On February 1, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy was introduced to an Executive Vice President of a large technology company (referred to as “Company A”) to
discuss future opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between Company A and the Company.
On February 11, 2021, during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy provided an overview of various debt and equity
financings undertaken by peer group companies in the technology and healthcare industries and other strategic transactions announced by such peer
group companies. The members of the Company Board discussed various strategic alternatives with management, including raising additional capital to
fund acquisitions and research and development via an offering of additional equity or convertible debt or an expansion of the Company’s revolving
credit facility, strategic partnerships, and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate achievement of its corporate objectives and mission.
Dr. Dunleavy also provided an overview of his engagement with PE Firm A and Company A to date (as described above). The independent members of
the Company Board then met in executive session. Following this discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized management to
engage in discussions with financial advisors who could potentially assist the Company Board with an exploration of various strategic alternatives,
including methods for raising strategic capital. At this time, the Company Board and management were focused on the evaluation of potential capital
markets and debt transactions, but the Company Board nonetheless specifically instructed management to select a financial advisor who would be
capable of advising on any and all potential strategic alternative transactions being considered.
From mid-March 2021 to mid-April 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in several follow-up conversations with representatives of Company A to further
discuss opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between the Company and Company A. On April 14,
2021, Dr. Dunleavy and five (5) additional members of the Company’s executive and senior management participated in a videoconference with
representatives of Company A during which the Company and Company A discussed the Company’s data, connectivity, analytical, and broader cloud
platform capabilities, as well as potential strategic opportunities for the two companies to partner in the future.
On April 20, 2021, Daniel Berglund, a Partner at one of the entities that provides advice and makes recommendations to the investment manager of
Nordic Capital X (collectively, the “Nordic Capital Advisors”), arranged for an introduction via email to Dr. Dunleavy.
On May 3, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented a preliminary evaluation of the Company’s financial position and
leverage profile, an assessment of market conditions generally and a preliminary comparison of the Company to other peer group companies. At the
meeting J.P. Morgan discussed its views on various potential strategic alternatives, including capital markets transactions, a refinancing of the
Company’s revolving credit facility, strategic partnerships, a sale of the Company and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate and
achieve its corporate objectives and mission. After extensive discussion, the Company Board concluded that the Company’s management should explore
potential market interest in an acquisition of the Company before proceeding with any capital markets or debt transactions due to the potentially dilutive
effect of such transactions on stockholder value. Dr. Dunleavy stated that, should the Company explore a sale, Dr. Dunleavy would only support a
transaction as a stockholder in which all stockholders received the same amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company
Board then met in executive session. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the
engagement of J.P. Morgan in order for J.P. Morgan to pursue a multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential equity offering facilitated by one or more
investment banks, (ii) a potential increase in the Company’s current credit line or revolver or both, and (iii) the initial exploration and assessment of
potential strategic partnerships that could further accelerate the Company’s achievement of its corporate objectives and mission, as well as a potential
sale of the Company. J.P. Morgan was selected by management and the Company Board based, in part, on J.P. Morgan’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company’s industry and its ability to manage a multi-track process that
involved exploration of multiple strategic alternatives in parallel.
On May 18, 2021, the Company hosted a virtual investor day in which members of the Company’s management presented a detailed overview of the
Company’s vision, growth strategy, markets, cloud-based platform capabilities, and financial information, including earnings guidance for fiscal year 2021.
Members of the public were invited to attend the virtual investor day, and a replay of the event, as well as a copy of all presentation materials, were
posted to the Company’s website following the event.

During the period from early May 2021 through July 2021, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company’s
management, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted over 20 potential counterparties, including PE Firm A and Company A and other potential strategic
counterparties and financial sponsors (but not including Nordic Capital X), to gauge their interest in potential transactions with the Company, including a
sale of the Company. J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company’s management, informed each party
that any proposals involving an acquisition of the Company should be structured such that all of the Company’s stockholders receive the same amount
and type of consideration. The Company entered into 13 confidentiality agreements (all but one of which contained standstills) with interested parties,
including PE Firm A and Company A. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, along with Dr. Dunleavy and Jonathan Boldt, Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, participated in management meetings with 13 of the parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide further information regarding the
Company and its financial performance. Among the parties, three large technology companies (including Company A, with the latter two referred to as
“Company B” and “Company C”) conveyed interest in an acquisition or strategic partnership with the Company.
On May 26, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in a videoconference with multiple representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors, including Mr.
Berglund and Fredrik Näslund, during which they mentioned that Nordic Capital X may be interested in exploring an acquisition of the Company.
On June 4, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a
private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm B”) containing a summary of terms under which PE Firm B would be interested in acquiring the Company. J.P.
Morgan had not included PE Firm B in their initial outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, and prior to receiving PE Firm B’s
indication of interest, neither J.P. Morgan nor the Company had any discussions with PE Firm B regarding strategic transactions or a potential
acquisitions of the Company. PE Firm B’s letter included a valuation range of $36.00 to $39.00 per share, payable in cash. On the basis of the non-binding
indication of interest, Dr. Dunleavy instructed J.P. Morgan to invite PE Firm B to execute a confidentiality agreement and commence due diligence on the
Company. On June 6, 2021, PE Firm B executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On June 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm A.
PE Firm A’s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $35.00 per share in cash, subject to
further due diligence and negotiations.
On June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a private
equity firm participating in the process based on J.P. Morgan’s original outreach to financial sponsors (referred to as “PE Firm C”). PE Firm C’s indication
of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $34.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due
diligence and negotiations.
On June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received an updated non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm B.
PE Firm B’s letter included a valuation range of $38.00 to $40.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash
consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity.
On June 9, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented an update on the Company’s multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential
equity offering facilitated by one or more investment banks; (ii) a potential increase in the Company’s current credit line or revolver or both; and (iii)
interest in a strategic partnership with or acquisition of the Company sought via outreach to various potential acquirers of the Company, including public
companies and private equity firms. J.P. Morgan also presented a preliminary summary of valuation perspectives on the Company, including historical
trading data and equity value per share derived from trading multiples, transaction multiples and a discounted cash flow analysis. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan also provided an update on: (i) the three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C,
respectively, all of which remained subject to various contingencies, including ongoing diligence of the Company and continued engagement with
Company management, and (ii) continuing engagement with several large technology companies (including Company B and Company C).
Representatives of J.P. Morgan also informed the Company Board that Company A had indicated that it would no longer be participating in the process.
Dr. Dunleavy reiterated his commitment to support potential sale transactions as a stockholder only if all of the Company’s stockholders received the
same amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive session. Following the presentation and
ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the engagement of Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to as “Latham &
Watkins”) as legal counsel to the Company in connection with its exploration of, among other options, a potential equity offering and/or
23
Table of Contents
refinancing of its revolving credit facility and a potential sale of the Company or strategic partnership with the Company. The Company Board selected
Latham & Watkins based, in part, on its experience representing companies engaged in a multi-track strategic alternatives review that could involve one
or more capital markets and M&A transactions.
On June 11, 2021, the Company retained Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Company.
On June 17, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy presented an update on the three preliminary, non-binding indications of
interest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C. Dr. Dunleavy informed the Company Board that: (i) PE Firm A had informed J.P. Morgan that it
was unwilling to increase the price per share from what was included in its original indication of interest and (ii) PE Firm B was continuing its due
diligence review of the Company. Additionally, Dr. Dunleavy informed the board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, and the
Company’s management continued to engage with several large companies in the software and technology industries (including Company B and
Company C) regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive
session. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board instructed the Company’s management to
continue its exploration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company.
During the period from mid-June through mid-July 2021, the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the
Company’s management, continued discussions with Company B and Company C. While both companies initially expressed interest in potentially
acquiring the Company, both later determined that they would instead be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential
bidders.
To date, J.P. Morgan had not included Nordic Capital X in its outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors. In late June 2021, based
on the preliminary conversation held between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (as described above), Dr. Dunleavy
instructed J.P. Morgan to reach out to Nordic Capital X and invite it to participate in the ongoing strategic alternatives review. On June 24, 2021, Nordic
Capital X executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On July 1, 2021, PE Firm B submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest revising its proposed price to $38.00 per share in cash. At the
direction of the Company’s management and based on discussions of the Company Board at the meeting held on June 17, 2021, J.P. Morgan informed PE
Firm B that it would need to increase its proposed price per share in order to proceed in the process. PE Firm B responded that it would not increase its
price, and that representatives of J.P. Morgan should notify it if circumstances change and there was an opportunity to move forward at PE Firm B’s
proposed price.
On July 2, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with the CEO of a company in the healthcare industry (referred to as “Company D”) to discuss the capabilities
and industry vision of the Company. Based on the initial discussion, the parties agreed to meet again on July 3, 2021. During a follow-up discussion
between Dr. Dunleavy and the CEO of Company D on July 12, 2021, the CEO of Company D expressed an interest in exploring an acquisition of the
Company. On July 13, 2021, Company D executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On July 5, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (including Kristoffer Melinder, Mr. Naslund and Mr.
Berglund) in person to discuss a potential transaction in which Nordic Capital X would acquire the Company. Detailed terms of the potential transaction
(including price and structure) were not discussed, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors indicated that Nordic Capital X would follow up
with a written indication of interest. During the meeting, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors observed that, in transactions of a similar size and
assuming an advanced stage of discussions, Nordic Capital X would typically request that members of management participate in a rollover of their
investment. Dr. Dunleavy stated that he could not consider any rollover at this point but he understood Nordic Capital Advisors’ position, and he would
only be willing to discuss the matter further if Nordic Capital X’s rollover proposal was supported by the Company Board.
On July 6, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited email from an additional private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm D”) expressing an interest
submitting an indication of interest in acquiring the Company. Dr. Dunleavy forwarded the email to representatives of J.P. Morgan, who, at the direction of
the Company’s management, invited PE Firm D to participate in the sale process. On July 7, 2021, PE Firm D executed a confidentiality agreement (which
contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.

On July 12, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a written preliminary, non-binding indication of interest from Nordic Capital X addressed to the Company
Board. Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $43.00 per share in
cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Nordic Capital X’s
indication of interest expressly stated that it was not contingent on any member of management participating in a rollover of their holdings and also
expressly stated that, if the contemplated equity financing for the transaction were to include any material participation by the Company’s significant
stockholders, then Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest was conditioned on (1) the Company Board forming a special committee of independent
directors to consider Nordic Capital X’s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board and indicated
that Nordic Capital X would not move forward with their proposal unless it is recommended by such a special committee, and (2) adoption of the Merger
Agreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such significant shareholders. The indication of interest
requested that the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement with Nordic Capital X for a period of up to four weeks in order for Nordic Capital X to
complete its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement, which request for exclusivity was not granted by the Company or the Company Board.
On July 13, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &
Watkins to discuss the indication of interest received from Nordic Capital X and the preliminary outreach from PE Firm D. J.P. Morgan advised the Board
that PE Firm D indicated verbally that it was prepared to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest in the low $40 per share, payable in cash,
but that PE Firm D would require an additional six weeks to complete its due diligence review of the Company. Additionally, J.P. Morgan informed the
Company Board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, and the Company’s management continued to seek out and engage
with other potential buyers or strategic partners of the Company, including companies in the software and technology industries, and while no other
party had submitted an indication of interest in acquiring the Company, certain potential strategic partners (including Company B and Company C)
suggested that they would be interested in participating in an equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. The Company Board discussed the
possibility of requesting that Nordic increase its offer price to $44.00 per share and provide further details on its sources of debt and equity financing in
exchange for the Company accepting its request for a period of exclusivity. The Company Board also discussed the likelihood that Nordic Capital X may
request that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion of his shareholding in the Company in light of the Company Board’s understanding of
typical market practices for financial sponsors and the statements made during the July 5 meeting between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the
Nordic Capital Advisors and in Nordic Capital X’s July 12, 2021 indication of interest with regard to a rollover. After extensive discussions with J.P.
Morgan and Latham & Watkins, including regarding its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a possible acquisition or merger and appropriate
approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest as originally discussed by the Company Board in June 2020 after consultation with
outside counsel, the Company Board decided to form a special committee of the Company Board in the event that Nordic Capital X proposed transaction
terms that would include Dr. Dunleavy or any affiliate of the Company receiving different consideration than the Public Stockholders. The Company
Board also authorized J.P. Morgan and the Company’s management to continue discussions with Nordic Capital X and propose a price of $44.00 per share
in exchange for the Company considering entering into an exclusivity agreement. The Company Board instructed Latham & Watkins to prepare a form of
exclusivity agreement that could be used in the event that the Company Board decided to accommodate Nordic Capital X’s request for exclusivity.
On July 14, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted to J.P. Morgan an updated, written non-binding indication of interest addressed to the Company
Board outlining a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $44.00 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence,
which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including equity that Nordic Capital X expected to raise from third parties.
While the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a potential rollover by members of the Company’s management or the
Company’s significant stockholders, the indication of interest again expressly conditioned any rollover structure on (1) the Company Board forming a
special committee to consider Nordic Capital X’s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board, and (2)
adoption of the Merger Agreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such shareholders participating in
such rollover (the “Approval Conditions”). The updated indication of interest reiterated Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations.
On July 14, PE Firm D informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that it would no longer be participating in the process.
On July 15, 2021, in response to Nordic Capital X’s updated indication of interest, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared a draft exclusivity
agreement that was prepared by Latham & Watkins with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors.
On July 15, 2021, representatives of Company D participated in a management presentation with Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to provide information
regarding the Company and its financial performance.

On July 16, 2021, representatives from Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, outside counsel for the
investment manager of Nordic Capital X (referred to here as “Kirkland & Ellis”) in which the parties discussed process matters and due diligence
information. During this call representatives of Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the fact that the Company Board was meeting soon to
consider and approve the establishment of a special committee and also that they would each expect the special committee would need to evaluate
whether the Company should enter into any exclusivity arrangement with Nordic Capital X.
On July 18, 2021, the CEO of Company D informed Dr. Dunleavy that Company D would require at least 90 days to complete its due diligence review
of the Company and was therefore was not able to submit an indication of interest on a timeline that would be competitive with other potential bidders.
However, the CEO of Company D noted that it would be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders in an
amount up to $500 million, and Company D planned to continue its due diligence review in order to potentially participate in such an investment.
On July 18, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &
Watkins to discuss and receive an update on discussions with Nordic Capital X and other potential acquirers and strategic partners. Based on
discussions that occurred following the July 13, 2021 meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan indicated that they were increasingly confident that
Nordic Capital X would be able to assemble an equity financing consortium to support a $3.5 billion equity commitment and secure $3 billion of debt
financing commitments that was outlined in its most recent indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also noted that Company D had stated it expected to
participate in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. While the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a
potential rollover by members of the Company’s management or the Company’s significant stockholders, the Company Board again discussed the
possibility that Nordic Capital X may request that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover and determined that such a request from Nordic Capital X was
reasonably likely. Accordingly, representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a
possible acquisition or merger, appropriate approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a
director is a large stockholder. Following extensive discussions with its legal and financial advisors and consistent with its discussions on June 17, 2020
and July 13, 2021, the independent members of the Company Board unanimously passed resolutions, effective as of July 18, 2021, to form the Special
Committee, with Mr. Teuber, William D. Green and Mark A. Pulido as its members. The Company Board determined each member of the Special Committee
to be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from, Dr. Dunleavy and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special
Committee’s mandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the Company Board to review, evaluate and negotiate
potential strategic alternatives, including the power to reject one or more proposals and not engage in any transaction, to retain its own advisors and to
make a recommendation to the Company Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the Company Board would not
recommend any potential transaction to the Company’s stockholders without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. Dr. Dunleavy
expressed his full support for the establishment of the Special Committee while abstaining from the vote itself.
On July 20, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss, among other topics,
organizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee’s work, including the election of Mr. Teuber as its chairman. After discussion and deliberation,
the Special Committee approved the selection of Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Special Committee. The Special Committee selected Latham &
Watkins based, in part, on their industry knowledge and experience, experience representing special committees in circumstances similar to that of the
Special Committee and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company’s management (including Dr. Dunleavy) and Nordic Capital X. The Special
Committee determined that, although Latham & Watkins had been retained in June 2021 as counsel to the Company, Latham & Watkins was not the
Company’s historic counsel and was independent of Company management and Dr. Dunleavy. Additionally, the Special Committee approved the
selection of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (referred to as “Morris Nichols”) as special Delaware counsel to the Special Committee based, in part,
on their experience with matters of Delaware Law and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company’s management and potential bidders. The
Special Committee also discussed the various potential financial advisors that the Special Committee would consider for engagement as independent
financial advisors to the Special Committee. After discussing multiple potential financial advisors to the Special Committee, the Special Committee
directed Mr. Teuber to work with Latham & Watkins to contact Evercore and another experienced financial advisor with a national reputation to present
their credentials to the Special Committee. The Special Committee also discussed the Company’s efforts through J.P. Morgan to seek out and engage with
potential strategic and private equity acquirers of the Company, the projections that were prepared by management of the Company and Nordic Capital
X’s most recent indication of interest. The Special Committee noted Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and the fact that a
draft form of exclusivity agreement had previously been shared with Nordic Capital X. The Special Committee determined that it would not authorize the
Company
26
Table of Contents
to enter into an exclusivity agreement until Nordic Capital X provided greater clarity on its sources of financing necessary to support the economic terms
outlined in its indication of interest, including any contemplated rollover by members of management and significant stockholders. The Special Committee
authorized Latham & Watkins to contact Kirkland & Ellis to inform them of the decision.
Following the Special Committee meeting, representatives of Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis in
which Latham & Watkins confirmed to Kirkland & Ellis that the Company Board had formed the Special Committee and that the Special Committee would
need to authorize and approve any exclusivity agreement.
On July 21, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors requested (via J.P. Morgan) that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion
of his investment in the Company. On the same date, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee of this request and indicated that he would be willing
to consider a potential rollover of some portion of investment in the Company if discussions with Nordic Capital X were to progress favorably and if the
Special Committee was supportive of Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also indicated that be believed that Mr. Andre Hoffmann (a
holder of Company Class A Shares and a beneficial interest in the Company Class B Shares held by Cape Capital) would be willing to consider a potential
rollover of some portion of Cape Capital’s investment in the Company. Following deliberations, the Special Committee determined that it was unlikely that
Nordic Capital X would proceed with the acquisition without securing a rollover commitment from Dr. Dunleavy. Accordingly, based on the Special
Committee’s understanding that Nordic Capital X would not proceed with a transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy participated in a rollover, the Special
Committee authorized Dr. Dunleavy to commence preliminary negotiations with Nordic Capital X regarding a potential rollover of a portion of Dr.
Dunleavy’s and Cape Capital’s investment in the Company.
On July 22, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended at various times by representatives of Evercore and another experienced financial
advisor to further evaluate each financial advisor’s capabilities. During the portion of the meeting attended by representatives of Evercore, the Special
Committee inquired about any material relationships that Evercore may have with the Company or potential counterparties that may impair its
independence. Evercore confirmed that it had no material relationships with the Company and committed to delivering a written memorandum
summarizing its material relationships with potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy. Following the presentations by
Evercore and the other potential financial advisor, the members of the Special Committee and representatives of Latham & Watkins had further
discussions about the qualifications, experience and independence (including any material relationships with the Company and potential counterparties,
including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy, disclosed by each financial advisor during the meeting) of each potential financial advisor, and the financial
analyses and other actions to be performed by the Special Committee’s financial advisor. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee
directed Mr. Teuber working with Latham & Watkins to obtain engagement proposals from each potential financial advisor.
On July 23, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss the engagement proposals and
presentations of each potential financial advisor to the Special Committee. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee approved the
selection of Evercore as independent financial advisor to the Special Committee, based in part on Evercore’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its
knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company’s industry and take-private transactions generally, its knowledge of the Company’s
business and affairs. The Special Committee directed Mr. Teuber to communicate the engagement selection to Evercore that day and have them
commence work. The Special Committee entered into an engagement letter with Evercore on August 10, 2021.
On July 23, 2021, the CEO of Company D called representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Dr. Dunleavy to inform each of them that
Company D was no longer interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other bidders and would instead focus on other initiatives.
On July 25, 2021, at a meeting of the Special Committee attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins, J.P. Morgan
presented a detailed preliminary summary of the bidder outreach conducted and indications of interest received to date and the criteria used to seek out
these potential bidders. After J.P. Morgan left the meeting, the Special Committee discussed the presentation and its overall assessment of bidder
outreach extensively with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins.
In late July 2021 and August 2021, the Special Committee held a total of 23 meetings with its advisors in which they discussed updates on the sale
process, the due diligence being conducted by Nordic, the Company’s management’s financial forecast, Evercore’s preliminary financial analyses of the
Company, the Company’s management’s proposal regarding treatment of equity incentives for employees, and key issues in a draft Merger Agreement
and ancillary documents. All

meetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Latham & Watkins. During these meetings, the
Special Committee again discussed Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and determined that no period of exclusivity would
be granted unless Nordic Capital X provided detailed information on sources of financing. Additionally, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed
the proposed terms of a Merger Agreement that would be provided to Nordic Capital X. The draft expressly stated that in addition to the stockholder
vote required by Delaware law, the Special Committee would, consistent with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposals, further require that the majority of Public
Stockholders also approve the transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed that this so-called “majority of the minority” vote would,
consistent with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposals, be a non-waivable condition for the transaction, and that such vote requirement would also be
communicated to Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital in the event they agreed to roll over any of their shares of the Company. Additionally, the Special
Committee and its advisors discussed various provisions in the Merger Agreement that were designed to maximize value and certainty for the Public
Stockholders, including a “go shop” that would allow the Company to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive
Merger Agreement.
During this same period, following the discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors that were authorized by the Special
Committee on July 21, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he had originally indicated to Nordic Capital X that, if the Special
Committee was supportive of Nordic Capital X’s proposal to acquire the Company, that he would be willing to consider participating in a rollover in an
amount up to $400 million, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors had informed him that Nordic Capital X would not be likely to proceed with
a transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy increased the proposed size of his rollover to $700 million. Dr. Dunleavy also informed the Special Committee that Mr.
Hoffmann would be willing to consider coordinating a rollover by Cape Capital in an amount up to $300 million. The Special Committee authorized Dr.
Dunleavy to negotiate with Nordic Capital X about the size of his and Cape Capital’s rollover and to initiate negotiations regarding agreements relating to
the rollover arrangements, subject to the Special Committee’s review and approval. Members of the Special Committee also recommended that Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital retain independent legal advisors.
On July 26, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2021-2023 financial projections for the
Company prepared by management (the “Projections”) and the assumptions underlying such Projections. Also in attendance were representatives of
Latham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the Projections and confirmed that such
Projections were consistent with metrics used in ordinary-course quarterly presentations to the Company Board and the guidance shared with the public
during the May 18 2021 virtual investor day. Mr. Boldt also confirmed that the Projections were consistent with the diligence materials shared with Nordic
Capital X and all other potential bidders and strategic partners. After extensive discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved
the Projections for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore. During this meeting, the members of the Special Committee and
Latham & Watkins updated the independent directors of the Board who are not on the Special Committee about the analyses and activities undertaken by
the Special Committee.
On July 26, 2021, the Special Committee with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, discussed the process of evaluating
alternatives, Nordic Capital X’s due diligence and the projections presented by the Company’s management at the Company Board meeting earlier in the
day.
On July 27, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting that Nordic Capital X was in discussions to acquire the Company. In light of the
preliminary stage of negotiations and the absence of specific details, neither the Company nor Nordic Capital X issued a comment on the Bloomberg
article.
On July 28, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan transmitted to the Company Board a written memorandum disclosing J.P. Morgan’s material
relationships with respect to the Company and Nordic Capital X.
On July 29, 2021, representatives of Evercore transmitted to the Special Committee a written memorandum disclosing Evercore’s material
relationships with respect to several potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy.
On July 30, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital had retained Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP
(referred to as “Morgan Lewis”) as their legal counsel.
On August 1, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2024-2025 financial extrapolations
for the Company prepared by management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions underlying such extrapolations. Also in
attendance were representatives of Latham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the
extrapolations. After Dr. Dunleavy and
28
Table of Contents
Mr. Boldt left the meeting and extensive discussion among the independent directors, the independent members of the Company Board approved the
extrapolations for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore. During this meeting, the members of the Special Committee and
Latham & Watkins updated the independent directors of the Board who are not on the Special Committee about the Special Committee’s activities,
Evercore’s views regarding the outreach to potential acquirers of the Company conducted by J.P. Morgan and Nordic Capital X’s ongoing due diligence
efforts and equity and debt financing activities.
On August 2, 2021, the Special Committee, with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, discussed the sale process and
the projections presented by management at the Company Board meeting on August 1, 2021. At the end of the meeting, the Special Committee invited Dr.
Dunleavy to join the meeting to provide his views to the Special Committee regarding the potential treatment of equity incentive compensation in
connection with a potential sale transaction.
On August 4, 2021, after extensive review by the Special Committee, the Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to circulate to Kirkland &
Ellis LLP an initial draft of the Merger Agreement relating to the proposed transaction which contained, among other terms favorable to the Company, a
“go shop” provision. Acting on the Special Committee’s instructions, Latham & Watkins circulated the initial draft of the Merger Agreement to Kirkland
& Ellis.
On August 5, 2021, the Special Committee, with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed the 2024-2030 financial
extrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company’s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions
underlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the Special Committee approved the ten-year extrapolations for use in valuation
analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore.
On August 6, 2021, independent members of the Company Board with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed
the 2024-2030 financial extrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company’s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the
assumptions underlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved the ten-
year extrapolations for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore (such 2024-2030 financial extrapolations, as approved by the
Special Committee and the independent members of the Company Board for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore, the
“Extrapolations”). During this meeting the Special Committee also provided an update on the proposal received from Nordic Capital X, Nordic Capital X’s
due diligence and financing, and the progress of negotiations of the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents. Latham & Watkins provided an
overview of the key terms of the Merger Agreement that was previously shared with Kirkland & Ellis to the independent members of the Company Board
who are not on the Special Committee.
On August 10, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis circulated to Latham & Watkins a revised draft of the Merger Agreement which removed the “go shop”
provision, proposed a Company Termination Fee representing 3.5% of the Company’s equity value and revised other key terms. Kirkland & Ellis also
circulated to Latham & Watkins initial drafts of the Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee.
On August 10, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in which representatives
of Evercore reviewed its preliminary financial analysis.
On the evening of August 10, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors verbally informed J.P. Morgan that Nordic Capital X was unable
to assemble an equity financing consortium at a price of $44.00 per share and accordingly Nordic Capital X would be unable to proceed with the proposed
transaction on the economic terms previously outlined in its non-binding indication of interest. Representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors stated
that Nordic Capital X planned to send an updated indication of interest that would outline a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders
would receive $40.50 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Representatives of the Nordic
Capital Advisors also informed J.P. Morgan that Nordic Capital X expected to request that Dr. Dunleavy increase his rollover amount to $1 billion to help
provide additional equity financing necessary to fund the proposed transaction.
On August 11, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss
the update provided by representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors. The Special Committee instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Evercore to reach out to a specified list of other potential buyers and strategic partners, in addition to those that had been contacted previously, to
assess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X’s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed
assess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X’s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed
the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore to re-solicit interest of the strategic and private equity bidders who had previously shown
29
Table of Contents
interest in exploring a transaction with the Company, including PE Firm B. The Special Committee also instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan to
inform Nordic Capital X that a price of $40.50 was inadequate and that the Special Committee would not approve any transaction in which Dr. Dunleavy
rolled over more than the $700 million contemplated in connection with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposal, as the Special Committee viewed any
transaction that included a lower price and an increased investment by Dr. Dunleavy as problematic. The Special Committee also instructed J.P. Morgan
and Latham & Watkins to discontinue Merger Agreement negotiations with Nordic Capital X until Nordic Capital X submitted a revised indication of
interest in writing with terms the Special Committee believed it could approve, including a detailed sources and uses table outlining the debt and equity
financing for a transaction.
On August 11, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the
Company’s stockholders would receive $40.25 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be
financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including a combined rollover amount by Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital of $1.1 billion. Nordic Capital X’s
updated indication of interest reiterated that given the rollover Nordic Capital X was requiring from Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Hoffmann, that Nordic Capital
X’s non-binding offer (and any subsequent offer) would be conditioned on the satisfaction of the Approval Conditions and that the Approval
Conditions would not be waivable. Based on prior instructions from the Special Committee, J.P. Morgan informed representatives of the Nordic Capital
Advisors that this proposal was unacceptable and that the Special Committee would not consider any further proposal from Nordic Capital X unless it
included a higher price per share and Dr. Dunleavy’s proposed rollover would not exceed the previously contemplated $700 million.
Between August 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021, J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, engaged in discussions with
representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors regarding revised economic terms for a potential transaction. As instructed by the Special Committee,
representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan also reached out to 10 potential counterparties, including PE Firm B and Company D as well as other
strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company at a price at or above $41.00 per share.
On August 13, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the
Company’s stockholders would receive $41.00 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including
a rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million and Cape Capital of $300 million.
The Special Committee held a meeting on August 13, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among
other items, an update on J.P. Morgan’s discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Nordic Capital X’s revised economic terms
for the transaction. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore also provided an update on their outreach to other potential counterparties that may be
interested in an acquisition of the Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore reported that certain potential counterparties declined to
participate further in a sale process, other potential counterparties responded with varying degrees of interest, but no potential counterparty had
expressed an interest in offering a price at or above $41.00 per share. As a result, the Special Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins to
resume discussions with Nordic Capital X and Kirkland & Ellis regarding the terms of a potential transaction on the revised economic terms proposed in
Nordic Capital X’s August 13 indication of interest.
On August 15, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest that provided greater detail on its sources of debt
and equity financing for the transaction, including a rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million (consistent with the amount that Nordic Capital X had
previously indicated was required in order for them to proceed with the transaction and the amount that the Special Committee had previously supported)
and an increased rollover by Cape Capital to $600 million (which increase was determined by the Special Committee at a subsequent meeting to be
necessary in order to finance all required payments in connection with the transaction). Nordic Capital X’s updated indication of interest included the
Approval Conditions.
The Special Committee held a meeting on August 16, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among
other items, the status of the communications with other parties who may be interested in a transaction with the Company at price at or above $41.00 per
share, the ongoing negotiations with Nordic Capital X and the open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Latham & Watkins stated
that, after extensive negotiations, the remaining material open issues in the Merger Agreement included: (i) whether a “go shop” provision allowing the
Company to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive Merger Agreement would be included, (ii) the relative sizes of
the Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fees, and (iii) the date on which the parties could terminate the Merger Agreement if the closing
conditions have not been satisfied at such time (other than as a result of breach by a party). Latham & Watkins explained that Kirkland & Ellis had
informed them that Nordic Capital X

would be unwilling to proceed with any transaction that included a “go shop” provision in the Merger Agreement. After extensive discussions, and
noting: (1) the extensive bidder outreach activity by J.P. Morgan and Evercore since May 2021 (including outreach to over 30 potential bidders, 14 of
which signed confidentiality agreements and commenced due diligence), (2) the Bloomberg article published almost three weeks earlier, (3) the fact that
the Company had not granted exclusivity to any potential bidder, (4) the fact that no other potential bidder had offered to acquire the Company at a price
at or in excess of $41.00 per share, (5) Nordic Capital X’s willingness to reduce the size of the Company Termination Fee to an amount representing to
2.75% of the Company’s equity value, (6) the high degree of deal certainty reflected in the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the size of the Parent
Termination Fee, the Equity Commitment Letter, Debt Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, and (7) the fact that Nordic Capital X was unwilling to
proceed with any transaction that included a “go shop” provision, the Special Committee determined that it would be reasonable to accept the removal of
the “go shop” provision in exchange for Nordic Capital X agreeing to a smaller Company Termination Fee, a longer Merger Agreement termination date
and other Company-favorable terms in the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to continue to negotiate the terms of
the Merger Agreement and finalize all ancillary documents.
Between August 16, 2021 and August 18, 2021, the Special Committee and Nordic Capital X through their respective legal advisors continued to
engage in ongoing negotiations of various definitive transaction documents, including the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited
Guarantee, and various ancillary agreements.
The Company Board held a meeting on the afternoon of August 17, 2021, at which time it reviewed with the Company’s management, together with
the Company’s and the Special Committee’s legal and financial advisors, a status update on negotiations of the definitive transaction. At the meeting,
Latham & Watkins reported on the resolution of certain key economic terms of the transaction and the remaining open issues in the definitive
documentation. Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed the terms of the Merger Agreement and other ancillary agreements. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan and Evercore reviewed the terms of the transaction, the sources and uses of funds in the transaction, and their respective financial analyses
of the Company. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive session and received a briefing from the members of the Special
Committee.
On August 18, 2021, representatives of Evercore transmitted to the Special Committee an update to its written memorandum disclosing Evercore’s
material relationships with respect to several potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy.
The Company Board met again on the afternoon of August 18, 2021 with the Company’s management, together with the Company’s and the Special
Committee’s legal and financial advisors to receive an update on the status of negotiations. The independent members of the Company Board then met in
executive session and received a briefing from the members of the Special Committee.
The Special Committee met again on the evening of August 18, 2021, at which time it reviewed with representatives from Evercore and Latham &
Watkins the final outcome of negotiations. Representatives of Evercore delivered to the Special Committee its opinion, subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its opinion, as of
August 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the Public Stockholders. After discussing the final terms of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee ultimately unanimously recommended
that the Company Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board met again on the evening of August 18, 2021, at which time the Special Committee conveyed its recommendation that the
Company Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company Board then reviewed with the Company’s management, together with the Company’s legal and financial
advisors, including representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins, the final outcome of negotiations. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, as
financial advisor to the Company rendered an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 19, 2021, that, based
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, as of August 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.

After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed merger described below and in the section entitled “Purpose and Reasons of the
Company for the Merger,” the independent members of Company Board (consisting of all members of the Company Board other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Nordic Capital X, the Merger and all of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; declared that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the Company enter
into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and recommended that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
At the same meeting, the members of the Audit Committee of the Company Board unanimously approved, consistent with the Company’s Audit
Committee Charter and applicable NASDAQ listing rules, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as a proposed transaction
between the Company and a related party.
On August 19, 2021, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto executed the Merger Agreement. On the same day, before the
opening of trading on NASDAQ, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement."""

As described in the section entitled “Background of the Merger,” the Company Board duly established the Special Committee and delegated to it
the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any
potential transactions with respect to the Company and any alternatives thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any such potential transaction or
any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms and conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives
thereto and, if the Special Committee deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of documents
pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction on behalf of the Company, (iii) determine whether such proposed transaction or any
alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders (and to the extent the
Rollover Stockholders were determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other shareholders, other than
the Rollover Stockholders), (iv) recommend to the full Company Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Company Board with respect to such
proposed transaction or any alternative thereto, and (v) retain independent legal counsel and such other consultants and agents, including, without
limitation, independent investment bankers, as the Special Committee deems necessary or appropriate to perform such services and render such opinions
as may be necessary or appropriate in order for the Special Committee to discharge its duties.
The Special Committee, acting with the advice and assistance of its independent legal and financial advisors, evaluated and negotiated the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and after careful consideration, at a meeting of the Special Committee held
on August 18, 2021, the Special Committee, among other things, unanimously:
•
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Public Stockholders;
•
recommended that the Company Board approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
and declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company’s stockholders; and
•
recommended that, subject to approval by the Company Board, the Company Board resolve to recommend that the holders of Company
Common Stock vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
On August 18, 2021, after careful consideration, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board
(other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself), among other things:
•
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders;
•
adopted and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
32
Table of Contents
•
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock for their adoption and approval; and
•
resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
In considering the recommendations of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) with respect to the Merger, you should
be aware that executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and the Company Board were aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger and in making its decision to recommend that the Company Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. For more information about these interests, refer to the section entitled “Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the
Company in the Merger.” The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believe that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to the Public Stockholders.
The Special Committee engaged its own legal and financial advisors and received advice throughout the negotiations from such advisors. Since the
members of the Special Committee are disinterested with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, independent of, and not
affiliated with, the Parent Entities or the Rollover Stockholders, the Special Committee believed that it could effectively represent the interests of the
Public Stockholders in negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its
decision to recommend that the Company Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations
and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) considered,
among other things, the following potentially positive factors, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of
importance:
•
the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Shares, including as set forth in the table under “Other Important
Information Regarding the Company — Market Price of Common Stock and Dividends,” taking into account the market performance of
the Company Class A Shares relative to the common stock of other participants in the industry in which the Company operates and general
market indices;
•
certain factors related to the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and the Company’s prospects and plans,
including:
•
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board with respect to the Company’s
business, operations, assets, financial condition, earnings, ownership structure, management, strategy, competitive position, current,
historical and projected financial performance, prospects and plans, as well as the associated risks involved achieving such
projections, prospects and plans;
•
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board with respect to economic and
market conditions and trends, as well as the challenges and uncertainty surrounding such conditions and trends, both on a historical
and prospective basis, in the near term and the long term, such as:
•
the nature of the industry in which the Company operates, including anticipated industry trends and rapidly changing
competitive and regulatory dynamics;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to ongoing industry consolidation and competition, including the ability of the Company
to be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the Company operates or may operate in the future without
significant further investment by the Company;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to potential increases in interest rates and the impact on debt and equity markets arising
from inflationary pressures, changes in monetary policies and other factors affecting global economic activity;
33
Table of Contents
•
the low barriers to entry in the technology industry generally, which increase the potential for challenges from new industry
competitors; and
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to anticipated structural changes in the Company’s industry due to technological
changes;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
which may have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash
flows;
•
the potential risks to the Company of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and
the risks relating to the Company’s dual class stock structure, including the risk that the holding of lower voting Class A Common
Stock may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to managers of
certain institutional investors;
•
certain compliance costs and obligations imposed on the Company as a result of having publicly traded common stock;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company’s concentrated stock ownership;
•
the management forecasts prepared by the Company’s management for, or otherwise made available to, the Special Committee and the
Company Board; and
•
certain challenges and limitations on the Company of continuing as a standalone public company, including the execution risk
associated with, and potential for business disruption and negative stock price reaction in connection with capital markets
transactions or a refinancing of the company’s revolving credit facility;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration consists solely of cash, providing the Company’s stockholders with certainty of value and immediate
liquidity at an attractive per Share equity value without the market or execution risks associated with continued independence;
•
the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the Merger
represents the best transaction reasonably available for Company stockholders in light of the foregoing factors as well as, among other
things:
•
the views of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement represented the
highest per Share consideration that could reasonably be obtained;
•
the conclusion of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock, was more favorable to such holders than the potential
value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including the alternative of remaining an
independent company and pursuing the Company’s current strategic plan, and other strategic or financial alternatives that might be
undertaken as an independent company, in light of a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties associated with those
alternatives, and the administrative and compliance costs associated with operating the Company as a publicly traded company;
•
that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself), with the assistance of their
respective independent legal and other advisors, had considered alternatives, including continuing to operate the Company on a
standalone basis, other potential value creating options or a sale to an alternative buyer, and considered the risks and uncertainties
associated with such alternatives, and each respectively formed the view that no other alternatives were reasonably likely to create
greater value for the Company’s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account the alternatives reasonably available to the
Company and the risk of execution, as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks (as more fully described under
“Special Factors — Background of the Merger”);
•
the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that, after a
thorough process, including extensive outreach to and negotiations with potential buyers, conducted at the direction of the Special
Committee, with the assistance of experienced independent legal and financial advisors, the Company obtained the best terms and
highest price that Parent is willing to pay for the Company and that further negotiations would have created a risk of causing Parent
to abandon the Merger altogether or materially delay the entry into definitive transaction agreements with respect to the Merger;
34
Table of Contents
•
the fact that since the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, none of the Company, Parent, the Special Committee, the
Company Board, nor any of their respective independent legal and financial advisors, as applicable, has received any inbound
inquiries from third parties related to potential alternative acquisition proposals; and
•

Merger Agreement and the structure of the transactions contemplated thereby, including, among others, the specific financial and
other terms and conditions set out below;

Agreement) that do not result from any breach of the non-solicitation obligations in the Merger Agreement, and the other terms and

that the Company may, in certain circumstances (i) furnish any information or access thereto to any third party making such an
Acquisition Proposal and its representatives and potential financing sources and (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or
discussions with such third party and its representatives and potential financing sources regarding such Acquisition Proposal,
provided, in each case, the Acquisition Proposal is received prior to obtaining the requisite Company Stockholder Approval with
respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in certain circumstances, including, among others, by the Company to accept and
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company pay Parent a Company Termination
Fee of $176,385,000 and expense reimbursement of up to $10,000,000, which amount the Special Committee and the Company Board
(other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and taking into account the range of
such termination fees in similar transactions, and the unlikelihood that a fee of such size would be a meaningful deterrent to other
acquisition proposals;
•
that the Company Board may, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, in certain circumstances, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, including in response to (i) a Intervening Event, or (ii) a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines constitutes a Superior Proposal; and
in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;
•

•
Parent having delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Equity Commitment Letter to which the
Company is a third party beneficiary, pursuant to which Nordic Capital X and its equity financing sources have committed to provide,
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, equity financing in an aggregate amount
of up to $3,175,000,000 to be used solely for the purpose of providing the financing for the transactions contemplated by the Merger

•
the Limited Guaranty, provided by the Guarantors, in favor of the Company, pursuant to which the Guarantors have agreed to
guarantee Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement, capped at $376,305,000, with respect to payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and certain expense reimbursement obligations of Parent;
•
the requirement that Parent and Merger Sub use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the regulatory approvals required to
consummate the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and

the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the Company

informed about the extent to which the interests of the Rollover Stockholders in the Merger differ from those of the Company’s other

rollover by the Rollover Stockholders and prior to any consideration of the terms of the Merger Agreement;

Stockholders or any of their respective affiliates, and who are not members of the Company’s management;

conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, (iii) determine whether such proposed transaction or any
alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and all of its stockholders (and
to the extent Dr. Dunleavy is determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other
shareholders, other than Dr. Dunleavy) and (iv) recommend to the full Company Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Company
Board with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto;

(as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”);

the possibility that the Parent Termination Fee of $368,805,000 and certain enforcement expenses in cash payable by Parent to the Company,
together with other specified amounts, may be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event that the Merger Agreement is
terminated by the Company due to (a) Parent’s breach of, or failure to perform its representations, warranties or obligations under the
Merger Agreement or (b) Parent’s failure to consummate the Merger at such time at which all of the applicable conditions to Closing have
been satisfied (subject to certain conditions);

Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally (as discussed under “Special
Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger”); and
•
the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, which could delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would
otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) concluded that, overall, the potentially positive
factors outweighed the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger. Accordingly, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
the Company’s stockholders.
In the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions,
determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself)
did not consider the liquidation value of the Company because (i) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (ii) they believed that
liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns, (iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be
impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of the Company. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee and the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant factor. Further, the Special Committee
and Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider the Company’s net book value, which is an accounting concept, as
a factor because they believe (i) that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of
historical costs and (ii) net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions, trends in the industry in which the
Company operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself) believe that the trading price of the Shares at any given time represents the best available indicator of the Company’s going concern value at that
time so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. In addition, the Special
Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) implicitly considered the value of the Company as a going concern by
taking into account the value of the Company’s current and anticipated business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects

and other forwardlooking matters, as well as by considering the discounted cash flow analysis presented by J.P. Morgan to the Company Board, as more
fully described below in the section entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 42, and, in the case of
the Special Committee, the discounted cash flow analysis presented by Evercore to the Special Committee, as more fully described below in the section
entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46. The full text of the written opinions of J.P.
Morgan and Evercore are attached as Annex D and Annex E to this proxy statement, respectively.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) are not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of
all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company
from anyone other than a filing person in the two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive, but is intended to summarize the material information and factors considered by the Special Committee
and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) in their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) reached the
decision to approve the entry into the Merger Agreement and recommend its adoption by the Company’s stockholders in light of the factors described
above and other factors that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believed were appropriate. In
view of the variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr.
Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered
in reaching their determinations. In addition, each of the directors of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) may have given different weight to different factors. The Special Committee and the Company Board conducted an overall review of the
factors described above, including through discussions with the Company’s management and their respective legal and financial advisors, and
considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, their decisions, determinations and recommendations. It should be noted that this
explanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and certain information
presented in this section is forward looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward Looking Information.”"""

Except for annual and quarterly guidance, the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future
performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions, estimates and
projections. In connection with its consideration of the Company’s stand-alone prospects and potential strategic transactions available to the Company,
management of the Company prepared and provided to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P. Morgan the Projections and
Extrapolations. The Special Committee subsequently directed Evercore, and the Company Board subsequently directed J.P. Morgan, to use the
Projections and Extrapolations in connection with rendering their fairness opinions to the Special Committee and to the Company, respectively and
performing their related financial analysis, as described above under the headings “— Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” and “—
Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor.” The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations is included in this proxy statement solely to give the
Company’s stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P.
Morgan. The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations may not be appropriate for other purposes and is not being included in this proxy statement
to influence a Company stockholder’s decision whether to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.
The Projections and Extrapolations were prepared by our management for internal use. The Projections and Extrapolations were not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP (as detailed below), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding
projections, the use of non-GAAP financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with
respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Company’s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best
available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of the Company’s management’s
knowledge and belief, the reasonable projections of the future financial performance of the Company.

Neither the Company’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. The reports of
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the Company’s historical
financial information. None of those reports extend to any of the Projections or Extrapolations described below and should not be read to do so.
The Projections and Extrapolations, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions
that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company’s management. Because the Projections and Extrapolations cover
multiple years, by their nature, they also become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to
the Company’s business and the industry in which it participates may affect actual results and result in the Projections and Extrapolations not being
achieved. For a description of some of these factors, the Company’s stockholders are urged to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings as well as
the discussion entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements” and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. In
addition, the Projections and Extrapolations may be affected by the Company’s inability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the
applicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of the Company or that
actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information.
The inclusion of the Projections and Extrapolations in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives considered or considers the Projections and Extrapolations to be necessarily predictive of actual
future events, and the Projections and Extrapolations should not be relied upon as such. Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any of the Company’s stockholders or any other person
regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the Projections and Extrapolations or can give any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections and Extrapolations, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections and Extrapolations to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections and Extrapolations were
generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections and Extrapolations
are shown to be in error. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Projections and Extrapolations,
except as otherwise required by law.
The Projections and Extrapolations include non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, which
were presented because management believed they could be useful indicators of the Company’s projected future operating performance. The Company
prepared the Projections and Extrapolations on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be
comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. As used herein, “GAAP” means generally accepted accounting principles.
All financial projections are forward looking statements. These and other forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020, and subsequent quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Please consider carefully the discussion entitled
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Information” elsewhere in the proxy statement.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and Extrapolations, the Company’s stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections and Extrapolations.

Pursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Company Board on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its August 18, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board, dated August 19, 2021,
that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated August 19, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s public common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was addressed to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger,
was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as
to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how
such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies J.P.
Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P.
Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded
securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed the Projections and Extrapolations; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of
its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and Parent with respect to certain aspects of
the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the
Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its
42
Table of Contents
engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not
conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or
Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.
Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses
or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions
with, and materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement and
pursuant to the certificate of incorporation. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the
Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,
regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all
material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse
effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
The Projections and Extrapolations furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company’s management, as discussed more fully under “Certain
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” The Company does not publicly disclose internal management Projections and Extrapolations of the
type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such Projections and Extrapolations were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These Projections and Extrapolations were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company’s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and
competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such Projections and
Extrapolations. For more information regarding the use of Projections and Extrapolations and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section
entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.
Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P.
Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion
as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any
class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger or with respect to
the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company’s common stock will trade at any future
time.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders, were determined
through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the
Company Parent. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of
the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the proposed
Merger or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its
opinion to the Company Board on August 18, 2021 and in the financial analysis presented to the Company Board on such date in connection with the
rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion
to the Company Board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the
financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.

Table of Contents
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged by the Company.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
•
NICE LTD.
•
PTC Inc.
•
Black Knight, Inc.
•
GoDaddy Inc.
•
Datto Holding Corp.
•
Qualys, Inc.
•
Mimecast Limited
•
Omnicell, Inc.
•
R1 RCM Inc.
•
Health Equity, Inc.
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, were considered in its judgment sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of the Company based on business
sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical or directly
comparable to the Company and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The
analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect the Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of firm value to the Wall Street research analyst
consensus estimate of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Based on the results of this analysis and
other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 18.5x – 24.0x. After applying such range to the
projected Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value
(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the common stock of the Company of $34.00 to $45.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the
Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the
implied per share consideration of $41.00.
Selected Transaction Multiple Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses
which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company’s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and familiarity
with the industries in which the Company operates (the “J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions”). The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as
relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:

None of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. Certain of these transactions may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed Merger. However, the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions were chosen because
certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other
factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each J.P. Morgan Selected Transaction, the multiple of the target company’s firm
value implied in the relevant transaction to the target company’s revenue for the next twelve-month period following announcement (the “NTM”) of the
applicable transaction (the “FV/NTM Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 7.0x to 11.0x. J.P. Morgan then
applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for the NTM as of August 3, 2021. The analysis indicated a range of implied equity
values per share (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $32.75 to $54.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company
common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per
share consideration of $41.00.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted
equity value per share for the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate
during fiscal years 2021E through 2030E based upon the financial Projections and Extrapolations prepared by Company management (as set forth in the
section entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company Board for use by
J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by
applying perpetual growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, based on guidance provided by the Company’s management and on J.P. Morgan’s
professional judgment and experience, to estimates of the unlevered terminal free cash flows for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2030E, as provided
in the Company management Projections and Extrapolations. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of
terminal values to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for the Company, which range was chosen by J.P.
Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and
the range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company as of August 3, 2021.
Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the Company common
stock of $34.00 to $51.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the
closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per share consideration of $41.00.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the
analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value
of the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving
at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether
any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered
the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.
However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and
45
Table of Contents
businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly
chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved
and other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company
with respect to the Merger and deliver an opinion to the Company Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience
and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of $42 million,
$3.0 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable
upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out
of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other
material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, Parent, Meritas Group, Inc., which holds
approximately 30% of the capital stock of the Company, GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture Partners, L.P. or 22C Capital LLC. During the two years preceding
the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had and continue to have commercial or investment banking relationships with
certain affiliates of Parent, including Parent’s parent company, Nordic Capital X, as well as certain affiliates of each of GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture
Partners, L.P. and 22C Capital LLC, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. In addition, J.P.
Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of GIC Pte. Ltd. and certain
affiliates of Insight Venture Partners, L.P., for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. During the two year period preceding delivery of
its opinion ending on August 18, 2021, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Nordic Capital X were approximately $15.2 million. During the
two year period preceding delivery of its opinion ending on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan did not recognize any fees from the Company or Parent. In the
ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments."""

Stockholders. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on August 18, 2021, Evercore rendered to the Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as
of August 18, 2021 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the
Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated August 18, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as
Annex E to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The Special Committee encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in
its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other
persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger.
Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.

Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special Committee on August 18, 2021 in connection
with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The
order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or
before August 13, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial conditions, industry sector
performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the
Company. The estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and
the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a
complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such
analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, free
cash flows, defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, taxes, capital expenditures, and changes in net working capital. Net
working capital is defined as the difference between current assets and current liabilities, that the Company was forecasted to generate during the
Company’s fiscal years 2021 through 2030 based on the Projections and Extrapolations. Evercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying
perpetuity growth rates of 3.00% to 4.00%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year
estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate based on the Projections and Extrapolations. The cash
flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00%,
which were based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s
estimated net debt

(calculated as total debt (including capitalized leases) less cash and cash equivalents) as of August 3, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of
Company common stock, in each case as provided by or based on information provided by the Company’s management, this analysis indicated a range
of implied equity values per share of Company common stock of $33.83 to $51.31, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company
common stock.

Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied (i) an
enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 22.0x – 28.0x to the Company’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar year 2021, (ii) an
enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 19.0x – 25.0x to the Company’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar year 2022, (iii) an

Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected these companies because they are publicly
traded Healthcare Technology and Technology / Software companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally
relevant to the Company for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with
regard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected
companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected
companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using the data of the selected companies.

Based on the multiples it derived from the selected transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore selected a
reference range of enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples of 7.0x to 11.0x and a reference range of enterprise value to NTM Revenue multiples of 6.0x
to 10.0x and applied these ranges of multiples to the Company’s LTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 based on the financial results for the Company
provided by the Company’s management and to the Company’s NTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 based on the Projections and Extrapolations. Based on
this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt (including capitalized leases) less cash and cash

Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly comparable to the Company and
none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or
businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of its financial
analyses. In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market
conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating
characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of
this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect
the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the multiples derived from the selected transactions.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but were
referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Company common stock during the twelve month period ended July 26, 2021, the last
trading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X, noting that the low and high closing prices during such
period ranged from $17.56 to $34.47 per share of Company Common Stock, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Company Common Stock prepared and published by equity
research analysts that were publicly available as of August 13, 2021. These price targets reflect analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading
price of the shares of Company common stock at the time the price target was published. As of August 13, 2021, the range of selected equity research
analyst price targets per share of Company Common Stock was $23.00 to $45.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts
do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Company Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings
estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future
general industry and market conditions.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 21 selected transactions and announced bids for control of US public targets with an
aggregate transaction value between $1 billion and $15 billion in the healthcare and technology industries since January 1, 2019. Using publicly available
information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such
transaction exceeded the unaffected market prices per share of the target companies prior to announcement of each transaction.

Table of Contents
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range of 20% to 35% (based on the
25th and 75th percentile of the premiums paid in the selected transactions) to the closing price per share of Company Common Stock of $32.71 as of July
26, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X. This analysis indicated a range of implied
equity values per share of Company Common Stock of $39.25 to $44.16, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common
Stock.
Preliminary Presentations
In addition to the presentation and financial analyses, dated August 17, 2021, made to the Special Committee described above in connection with
its opinion, dated August 18, 2021, a copy of such presentation has been attached as Exhibit (c)(ix) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed
with the SEC in connection with the Merger, Evercore also delivered preliminary written and oral presentation materials to the Special Committee on
August 10, 2021 and August 16, 2021 (collectively, the “Preliminary Presentation Materials”). A copy of the Preliminary Presentation Materials has been
attached as Exhibits (c)(vii) and (c)(viii) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger. Information
contained in the Preliminary Presentation Materials was substantially similar to the information provided in Evercore’s presentation and financial analyses
made to the Special Committee described above in connection with its written opinion. The financial analyses in the Preliminary Presentation Materials
were based on market, economic and other conditions as they existed as of the date of such presentation(s) as well as other information that was
available at such time. Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses differed due to changes in those conditions. Finally, Evercore continued to refine
various aspects of its financial analyses with respect to the Company over time.
The Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings or make any recommendations or
constitute an opinion of Evercore with respect to the fairness of the Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Evercore in
relation to its opinion dated August 18, 2021 superseded all analyses and information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by
Evercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible
to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the
results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its
opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all
the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of Company
common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to the Public Stockholders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the
business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Special Committee (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee or the Company’s management or that any specific
amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger for the holders of Company Common Stock.

Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has agreed to pay Evercore a retainer fee for its
services equal to $3 million which was payable upon execution of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee. The Company also agreed to
pay Evercore an opinion fee equal to $1 million upon delivery of Evercore’s opinion which is fully creditable against the $3 million retainer fee. The
Evercore engagement letter also provides for, at the conclusion of the assignment thereunder, an additional discretionary fee in an amount not to exceed
$7 million, based upon, among other things, the resources expended by Evercore in the course of the assignment, the Special Committee’s satisfaction
with the services rendered and the benefit to the Special Committee of the successful conclusion of the assignment, to be determined by the Special
Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition, the Evercore engagement letter provides for additional fees to be paid to Evercore if the Special
Committee and Evercore agree to expand the scope of Evercore’s services, which fees shall be mutually agreed between the parties. The Company has
also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other

financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror and their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC, Insight and their
respective affiliates, in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate
finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In
connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which

Under a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, Nordic Capital X, Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL, Parent
and Merger Sub (together, the (“Parent Entities”)) may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their beliefs as to the
fairness of the proposed Merger to the Public Stockholders. Parent and Merger Sub are making the statements included in this section solely for
purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of Parent and
Merger Sub as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder
should vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have interests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition
to, those of the other stockholders of the Company.
Parent and Merger Sub did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or other advisors of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr.
Dunleavy, who recused himself) as to, the fairness of the Merger. The Parent Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any
valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholder. Based on, among other things, the factors
considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Company Board (other than Mr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and the Special
Committee discussed in “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the
Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” (which analysis and resulting
53
Table of Contents
conclusions Parent and Merger Sub adopt), Parent and Merger Sub believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the Public Stockholders. In particular,
the Parent Entities considered the following:
•
the fact that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) unanimously determined that
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and the Company’s stockholders;
•
the fact that no member of the Company’s senior management other than Dr. Dunleavy has a substantial financial interest in the Merger that
is different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Public Stockholders generally, although the Merger Agreement does include
customary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the Company’s officers and directors;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing the Company’s stockholders to immediately realize a certain and fair value
for their Shares, which value represents a significant premium over the closing price of the Shares on July 26, 2021, the last trading day prior
to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X;
•
the fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the Public Stockholders without the delays that would otherwise be necessary in order to
liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales; and
•
the fact that the Merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the Merger will be received.
The Parent Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the Public Stockholders based upon, among other things, the following
factors:
•
the fact that the Special Committee retained, and had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal and financial advisors;
•
that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Special Committee’s extensive arm’s-length negotiations with Parent;
•
the fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the Company’s receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals that constitute Superior Proposals;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement related to a Superior Proposal, subject to paying Parent a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 in cash, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
•
the availability of appraisal rights to the Company’s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders) who comply with all of the required
procedures under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Shares.
The Parent Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the
proposed Merger, including:
•
that the stockholders of the Company (other than the Rollover Stockholders) will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in
value or growth of the Company’s business and will not benefit from any potential sale of the Company or its assets to a third party in the
future;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all;
•
that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the equity and funding commitments of the
Equity Investors and Debt Commitment Parties;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take
with respect to the operations of the Company pending completion of the Merger;
54
Table of Contents
•
the negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could potentially have on the Company’s business
and relationships with its employees, vendors and customers;
•
that the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating, or encouraging the submission of Acquisition Proposals from
Third Parties or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including payment to
Parent of a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 in cash, and the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the
opportunity for Parent to make revisions to its Merger proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to
acquire the Company;
•
the potential negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could have on the Company’s business
and relationships with its employees, vendors and customers; and
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to the Company’s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders with respect to
the Rollover Shares) that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Parent Entities in connection with the fairness of the
Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by them. The Parent Entities did not find it practicable to,
and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather, the
Parent Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The Parent Entities believe these
factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders. This position
should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities make no
recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger. The Parent Entities attempted to negotiate the
terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the stockholders of the Company, and, accordingly, did not negotiate the Merger
Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such stockholders. None of the Parent Entities believes that it has or had any fiduciary duty to
the Company or its stockholders, including with respect to the Merger and its terms.
Based on the Parent Entities’ knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, the Special Committee and the Company
Board, as well as discussions with members of the Company’s senior management regarding the Company and its business and the factors considered
by, and findings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and discussed in this proxy statement

through certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their beliefs as to
the fairness of the proposed Merger to the Public Stockholders. The Merger is the Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13E-3 Transaction
Statement has been filed with the SEC. As described below, the Rollover Stockholders believe that the Merger is fair to the Public Stockholders on the

Table of Contents
factors described under “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the
Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger.” Dr. Dunleavy did
not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the Company Board regarding the Merger, and did not receive advice from the legal or
other advisors of the Company or the Special Committee as to the fairness of the Merger. As disclosed under “Special Factors — Interests of Executive
Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger,” the Rollover Stockholders have interests in the Merger both the same as those of the Public
Stockholders by virtue of the expected receipt of the per Share Merger Consideration for a portion of the Rollover Stockholders’ equity interests in the
Company upon completion of the Merger, and not identical to those of the Public Stockholders by virtue of the Rollover Stockholders’ ability to roll over
a portion of their ownership stake in the Company (such rollover being valued with the same per Share valuation of the Shares used to determine the
Merger Consideration) in exchange for a continuing ownership stake in Parent.
The Public Stockholders were represented by the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their
behalf, with the assistance of the Special Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors. The Merger was approved by the directors of the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself). Based on the knowledge and analysis of the Rollover Stockholders of available
information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with the Company’s management regarding the Company and its business and the factors
considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself), the Rollover Stockholders believe that the Merger is substantively and procedurally fair to the Public Stockholders based upon substantially the
same factors considered by the Parent Entities with respect to the substantive and procedural fairness of the proposed Merger to such Public
Stockholders. See “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger” The Rollover Stockholders agree with the
analyses, determinations and conclusions described under “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,” and
“Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the Special Committee;
Fairness of the Merger.”
While Dr. Dunleavy is an officer and director of the Company, because of the interests described under the section captioned “Special Factors —
Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger,” he did not serve on the Special Committee or participate in the Special
Committee’s evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and he recused himself from and did
not participate in, or vote in connection with, the Company Board’s evaluation or approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. For these reasons, the Rollover Stockholders do not believe that their interests in the Merger influenced the decisions or
recommendations of the Special Committee or the Company Board with respect to the Merger Agreement or the Merger.

Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders and certain of their affiliates, including Dr. Dunleavy,
through the Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their purposes and
reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders. The Rollover Stockholders and their affiliates are making the statements in this section solely for the
purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. The Rollover Stockholders do not make any
recommendations as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.
Dr. Dunleavy has served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer since his organization of the company’s predecessor companies in 1998, as
Chairman of the Company Board since the creation of the board in 2006, and as President from the Company’s foundation until May of 2014. The Rollover
Stockholders considered favorable current market conditions, and
56
Table of Contents
concluded that a take-private transaction that would provide fair value to all of the Company’s stockholders, including the Public Stockholders, could be
attractive. Dr. Dunleavy indicated to the Company Board prior to the establishment of the Special Committee that he would only support a transaction as
a stockholder in which he received the same consideration as the Public Stockholders in respect of all Company Common Stock held by him. However,
following the establishment of the Special Committee, representatives of Nordic Capital Advisors indicated they were not prepared to move forward with
a proposed transaction without a significant rollover of existing Company Common Stock. As a result, the Rollover Stockholders eventually agreed to
enter into the Rollover Agreements because they believed that the overall benefits of the Merger outweighed the detriments to them associated with the
Rollover Agreements, including the lack of liquidity the Rollover Stockholders will have in the equity of Parent, the control of Parent by affiliates of
Nordic Capital X, and the increased risk associated with the leverage contemplated for the Company after closing. In determining to enter into the
Rollover Agreements, the Rollover Stockholders also considered the confidence they have in the existing management team and in the prospects of the
Company and in the track record of Nordic Capital Advisors to operate acquired companies.
The Rollover Stockholders believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders to effect a liquidity transaction while market
conditions remain favorable, as well as in the best interests of the Company to operate as a privately held entity. The Rollover Stockholders believe that,
as a privately held entity, the Company will have greater operational flexibility to pursue alternatives than it would have as a public company, and
management of the Company will be able to concentrate on long-term growth, reducing the focus on the quarter-to-quarter performance often emphasized
by the public equity market’s valuation of the Shares. Although the Rollover Stockholders believe that there may be substantial opportunities associated
with their contribution to Ocala Topco, LP of the Rollover Shares, the Rollover Stockholders recognize that there may also be substantial risks (including
the risks and uncertainties relating to the prospects of the Company) and that such opportunities may not ever be fully realized.
If the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Shares will cease to be publicly traded. For the
Rollover Stockholders, the purpose of the Merger is to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the separate Rollover
Agreements, which will allow the Rollover Stockholders to realize the value of a portion of their Shares by receiving $41.00 per Share in cash for a portion
of their investment in the Company and own equity interests of Parent and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed
and the Shares cease to be publicly traded. The Rollover Stockholders believe that structuring the transaction in such a manner is preferable to other
alternative transaction structures because (i) it will enable Parent to acquire all of the outstanding Shares of the Company at the same time; (ii) it
represents an opportunity for the Public Stockholders to immediately realize the value of their investment in the Company and for the Rollover
Stockholders to immediately realize the value of a significant portion of their investment in the Company at a price of $41.00 per Share in cash, without
interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) it
allows the Rollover Stockholders to continue to own indirect equity interests in the Company after the Merger and to bear the rewards and risks of such
ownership after the Merger."""

Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a

completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in compliance
with Applicable Law, the Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
The Parent Entities currently anticipate that the Company’s operations initially will be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially
as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent). The Parent Entities are currently conducting a review of the Company and its business and operations with a view towards determining how to
redirect the Company’s operations to improve the Company’s long-term earnings potential as a private company (including by reducing the Company’s
costs and expenses following the Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following completion of the
Merger, the Parent Entities will continue to assess the Company’s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties
and personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of the
Company. In addition, Parent may seek to buy or combine the Company with target companies that provide earnings and growth synergies; however, no
definitive contracts, arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understanding currently exist. Although presently there are no definitive contracts,

Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards
Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Option in writing, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price,
and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be
cancelled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company RSU Award in writing, each Company RSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a
cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Cash-Out Company RS Award in writing, each Cash-Out Company
RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be
achieved at the “target” level of performance).
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Conversion Company RS Award in writing, each Conversion
Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into a cash-based retention award in
an amount, without interest equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to the same vesting schedule that applied immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and requirements).
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case
later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time of the
Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the ESPP, each participant’s outstanding right to

Benefits of the Merger for the Company’s Public Stockholders
The primary benefit of the Merger to the Public Stockholders (other than the holders of any Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will be their
right to receive the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per Share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, representing a premium of 25.3% over the closing price of Company Class A
Common Stock on July 26, 2021, the last unaffected trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction, and a premium of 24.4% over
the volume-weighted average price of the Shares over the thirty (30) trading days leading up to the unaffected trading day. Additionally, such Public
Stockholders will avoid the risk after the Merger of any possible decrease in the Company’s future earnings, growth or value.
Detriments of the Merger to the Company’s Public Stockholders
The primary detriments of the Merger to the Public Stockholders include the lack of an interest of such Public Stockholders in the potential future
earnings, growth, or value realized by the Company after the Merger. In addition, the Public Stockholders will not benefit from any sale of the Company or
its assets to a third party in the future.

party, the Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the
Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management will
operate the Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today, and that the Company’s stockholders will continue to be
subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent the current market price of Shares reflects a
market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs and, under certain circumstances, reimburse up to $10,000,000 of Parent’s out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, as well as pay
certain enforcement costs. See “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”"""

In considering the recommendations of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) with respect to the Merger, the
Company’s stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of the Company have certain interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting solely of independent and
disinterested directors of the Company Board, and the Company Board were aware of these interests and considered the interests described below,
among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making their
recommendations.
Special Committee Fees
Consistent with past practice of the Company Board and its committees, the members of the Special Committee, consisting solely of independent
directors who (i) are not affiliated with Dr. Dunleavy (other than by virtue of serving as a director of the Company), (ii) otherwise do not have a material
interest in the Merger (other than an interest by virtue of their
59
Table of Contents
ownership of capital stock of the Company) and (iii) are disinterested with respect to the Merger, will not receive additional compensation in connection
with their services to the Company as members of the Special Committee with respect to the Merger.
Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards; Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to the Company equity awards that are outstanding at the Effective
Time.
Company Options. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Option in writing, each Company Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts payable in respect of
Company Options will be paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled
payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
The following sets forth, for each Company executive officer, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding
Company Options held by such executive officer assuming (i) the closing price of a Company Common Stock is $41.00 (the “Estimated Closing Value”), (ii)
a closing date of October 7, 2021, and (iii) such executive officer remains continuously employed with the Company or a subsidiary until the Effective
Time.

Change in Control Agreements; Change in Control Policy
In accordance with the requirements of Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits (on a pre-tax
basis) that each named executive officer would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such
named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of employment on October 7, 2021 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this
golden parachute compensation disclosure), (ii) a per Share price of $41.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, (iii) that
each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and
(iv) the equity awards described below are the only equity awards outstanding as of closing. The calculations in the table below do not include any
amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to
forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or any awards that, by their terms, vest
irrespective of the Merger prior to October 7, 2021. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the
relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer
may differ materially from the amounts set forth below.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under the Change in Control Policy to the
named executive officers, see “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation” below.
Indemnification Benefits
Each of the Company’s executive officers and directors is entitled to the indemnification benefits in favor of the Company’s directors and executive
officers, as described in more detail in “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.”

Cash. The Company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Wychulis on December 3, 2014, Jason Capitel on January 23, 2018 and
Peter De Bock on January 12, 2019, and a promotion letter with Jonathan Boldt on January 14, 2019 (such employment agreements, collectively, the
“Employment Agreements”). If we terminate the employment of a named executive officer other than for “cause” (as defined in their Employment
Agreements), subject to the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of us, we will provide him with a
lump-sum cash severance benefit equal to the greater of (i) one month’s base salary or (ii) one month’s base salary per each full year of his service
with us, subject to a maximum of six months’ base salary. However, as a condition of agreeing to changes to the vesting of outstanding equity
awards, including the treatment of Company RS Awards as Cash-Out Company RS Awards, each named executive officer agreed that any amounts
that would have been payable under the Employment Agreements prior to the closing date will reduce the amount payable in respect of the Cash-
Out Company RS Awards that are single-trigger payments as described below. If a named executive officer’s employment is terminated without
“cause” on the closing date, the full amount of the Cash-Out Company RS Award would be payable and no severance would be owed. On October
4, 2021 Jason B. Capitel’s and Peter De Bock’s employment ended. Amounts in this column will be paid subject to each’s execution of the
Company’s standard form of separation and release agreement.
In addition, each participant in our 2021 annual bonus program, including our named executive officers, would be entitled to his or her 2021 annual
bonus if and when annual bonuses are paid under the 2021 annual bonus program and the participant is eligible and an employee as of the 2021
annual bonus payment. These amounts would represent double trigger payments, which would be payable as a result of the occurrence of both the
consummation of the Merger and the relevant individual experiencing a qualifying termination of employment. The target bonus opportunities for
the 2021 annual bonus program for each of our named executive officers are: Dr. Dunleavy, $0, and Mr. Boldt, $281,250.

Equity. These amounts represent single-trigger payments that will occur solely as a result of the consummation of the Merger. Based on the Merger
Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable securityholder in writing (i) each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Inovalon common stock subject to such Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes; and (ii) each Cash-Out Company RS
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of
Inovalon common stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target”
level of performance), less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts for Messrs Jason B. Capitel and Peter De Bock take into account the
reduction from the cash severance benefit in connection with each’s separation from employment on October 4, 2021. Set forth above in the Section
“Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company — Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards” are the values of
each type of unvested Company equity award held by each named executive officer as of the date of this proxy statement that would become
vested upon the consummation of the Merger based on an assumed effective time of October 7, 2021.

The following discussion is a summary of material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to US Holders (as defined below) of the
Shares. This summary is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of US federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of the Shares in
light of their particular circumstances. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations
promulgated under the Code, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and
other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time, with possible retroactive effect. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following discussion, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court
will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or non-US jurisdiction, and does not consider any aspects of US federal tax law other than income taxation, nor does it address any aspects of
the unearned income Medicare contribution tax. In addition, this discussion only applies to the Shares that are held as a capital asset (generally, property
held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address tax considerations applicable to any holder of the Shares that
may be subject to special treatment under US federal income tax law, including:
•
a bank or other financial institution;
•
a tax-exempt organization;
•
a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account;
•
an S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an investor in an S corporation or other pass-through entity);
•
a person holding a direct or an indirect interest in Parent or Merger Sub;
•
an insurance company;
•
a mutual fund;

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds the Shares, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Any such
partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes), and any partners thereof, that hold the
Shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of exchanging the Shares pursuant to the Merger. In addition, holders of
Shares who are not US Holders may be subject to different tax consequences than those described below, and are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding their tax treatment under US and non-US tax laws.
The following summary is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Holders of Shares
are urged to consult their own tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their own particular
circumstances, including US federal estate, gift and other non-income tax consequences, and tax consequences under state, local and non-US tax laws.
US Holders
The following is a summary of the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger that will apply to US Holders. For purposes of this
discussion, the term US Holder refers to a beneficial owner of the Shares that is, for US federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident in the United States;
•
a corporation (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a “United
States person” under applicable Treasury regulations.
Exchange of the Shares for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The exchange of the Shares by a US Holder for cash in the Merger (or for
cash upon exercise of appraisal rights) will generally be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. A US Holder will generally recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger (or cash received upon exercise of appraisal rights) and the
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. Gain or loss will generally be determined separately for each block of the Shares (generally,
the Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) held by such US Holder. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if such US Holder’s holding period for the Shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the exchange. Long-term capital
gains recognized by a non-corporate US Holder are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain
limitations.
64
Table of Contents
Non-US Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-US Holder” is a beneficial owner of Shares that is neither a US Holder nor an entity or arrangement
classified as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes.
A Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for Shares pursuant
to the Merger, unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the Non-US Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-US Holder in the United States);
or
•
the Non-US Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of Shares pursuant to the Merger, and certain other requirements are met.
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax on a net income basis at generally applicable US
federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such Non-US Holder were a US Holder. A Non-US Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a
branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or lower rate specified in an applicable income tax treaty, on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain
items.
Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be
specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by US-source capital losses of the Non-US Holder (even though the individual is
not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-US Holder has timely filed US federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax
Proceeds from the exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Merger (or as a result of exercising appraisal rights) generally will be subject to
information reporting. In addition, backup withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 24%) generally will apply unless the applicable US Holder or
other payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by providing a properly
completed IRS Form W-9), or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding tax. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding tax rules from a payment to a US Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s US federal income tax
liability, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided, that, the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Each US Holder should duly
complete, sign and deliver to the exchange agent an appropriate IRS Form W-9 to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup
withholding tax, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent.
A Non-US Holder generally certifies its status as such by providing a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E (or other
applicable IRS Form W-8). A Non-US Holder that does not provide such form generally will be presumed to be a US Holder, subject to backup
withholding tax as described above."""

The Debt Commitment Parties have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) a seven (7) year
senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,340,000,000 (the
66

“Initial Term Facility”), (ii) a five (5) year, $250,000,000 super senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), (iii) a seven (7) year senior
secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250,000,000 (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”, together with the
Initial Term Facility and the Revolving Facility, the “Unitranch Facilities”) and (iv) a twelve (12) year second lien PIK term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount equal to $660,000,000 (the “Second Lien PIK Term Facility”).
The commitments will be secured by a perfected first-priority (in the case of the Unitranche Facilities and the guarantees in respect thereof) or
second priority (in the case of the Second Lien PIK Term Facility and the guarantees in respect thereof) security interest in substantially all of the present
and after-acquired tangible and intangible assets of Parent, the direct parent company of Parent, and each of Parent’s direct and indirect wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions, exclusion and permitted liens.
The obligations of the Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary terms and
conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Debt Commitment Letter, the absence of any Company Material
Adverse Effect, and certain other customary closing conditions.
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, or there is a
breach or repudiation by any Debt Commitment Party, Parent must use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain sufficient alternative financing from
the same or alternative financing sources, on terms containing no new or additional conditions to the consummation of such financing. There are
currently no such alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans in place.
The Merger Agreement provides that Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to arrange or
obtain the debt financing as promptly as practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement and to consummate the debt financing on or prior to the
Closing Date (as defined below). Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt financing, the failure of Parent to obtain
sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case, Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee.
Parent intends to repay the loans obtained in the debt financing by cash generated by the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries."""

vote such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal, will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section
262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Shares who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for
appraisal and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Information
about the Special Meeting — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully
and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not
seek appraisal of their Shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which you seek appraisal in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the demand through the Effective Time;
and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company Class A Common Stock, unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the
stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement

At the Effective Time, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will cease to be outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, for the benefit of holders of (i) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (a “Certificate”) and (ii) each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Book-Entry Share”), in each case, other than the
Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares.
Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, Parent will direct the Paying Agent
to send to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than the Cancelled Shares and
except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which specifies that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree.
Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or delivery of a customary affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor, as promptly as practicable (but, in any event, within
three (3) Business Days), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
The Paying Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. The Paying Agent may reduce the
amount of any Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares by any applicable withholding taxes. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, and certain dividends or other distributions pertaining to
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the Merger Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.

After the completion of the Merger, you will cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive certain dividends and other distributions, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement.
None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount of Merger
Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to, or become, the property of any governmental entity, any such Shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The Merger Agreement
The following describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and which is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The descriptions in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement are subject to, and qualified in their
entirety by, reference to the Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the
Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the Merger Agreement in its entirety before making any decisions
regarding the Merger because it is the principal document governing the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and are not intended to provide you with any factual information about us or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us
contained in this proxy statement or in our public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement and this summary are not intended to be,
and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts and circumstances relating to the Company. Such information can be
found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings we make with the SEC, as described in the section titled “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of each of the parties to the Merger Agreement that were made
only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with the negotiation of the Merger
Agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules and certain other disclosures exchanged between the parties to the Merger
Agreement, which are not reflected in the Merger Agreement) and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality which may differ from what may
be viewed as material by you or other investors. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement
and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of
establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the transactions contemplated thereby if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstances or otherwise, and allocating risk between the
parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations
and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures
by the Company. As of the date of this proxy statement, except as set forth in the Company’s public disclosures, there are no specific material facts that
exist that the Company believes materially contradicts its representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Company will provide additional
disclosure in its public reports to the extent it becomes aware of the existence of any specific material facts that are required to be disclosed under US
federal securities laws and might contradict its representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement. In any event, the representations and
warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided
elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this proxy statement have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Stockholders and other interested parties should read the Merger Agreement for a more complete description of the provisions summarized below.
The Merger
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL. Upon completion of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub will automatically
cease and the Company will continue its existence as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.”
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all rights, privileges,
powers, properties and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the obligations, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

The summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement set forth below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important
to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.
The Merger Agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Such
information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or, in the case of the Company, in the public filings that the Company makes with the SEC,
which are available without charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. For additional information, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find
More Information.”
The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified
and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is
important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and were
negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the
Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in some
cases were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by the Company, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. The
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement will not survive completion of the Merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter
of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the
Merger Agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may or may not have been included in the
Company’s periodic and current reports, this proxy statement and other documents filed with the SEC. For the foregoing reasons, the representations,
warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information
provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor
•
The Special Committee retained Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special
Committee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be

Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the
Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.

•
Purpose and Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger; Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the Fairness of the
Merger. Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders, including Dr. Dunleavy, through
certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their
purposes and reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders. For a description of the Rollover Stockholders’ purposes and reasons
for the Merger, and their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Purpose and
Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the
Fairness of the Merger.”
•
Certain Effects of the Merger; Treatment of the Shares. At the time at which the Merger becomes effective, being the time at which a
certificate of merger substantially in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the “Certificate of Merger”) is filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time and date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties to the
Merger Agreement and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company Class B Common Stock (the “Shares” and, each, a “Share”) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding a portion of the Shares held by the Rollover Stockholders, including certain
Shares held by Dr. Dunleavy and certain of his affiliates and certain holders of Company Class B Common Stock, that will, pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements, each dated August 19, 2021, separately entered in by the Rollover Stockholders and Parent, as they may be
amended from time to time (the “Rollover Agreements”), be exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc., which in turn will be
exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Rollover Shares”), Shares held by Parent or
Merger Sub (or any of their respective subsidiaries) or in the treasury of the Company (“Cancelled Shares”) and Shares that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not been voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and whose holders properly exercise and validly perfect appraisal rights with respect to
such Shares in accordance with, and who comply with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
2
Table of Contents
Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to be
outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement. For further information about the treatment of the Shares, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects of the Merger —
Treatment of the Shares.”
•
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a “Company Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an
amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be cancelled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Each award of restricted stock units, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (a
“Company RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Each Cash-Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and
terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS
Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of performance). For the purpose of the
Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, a “Cash-Out Company RS Award” means (a) with respect to Company RS Awards
held by an employee that has signed a release prior to the Closing Date, 30% of any unvested portion of such employee’s
Company RS Award, and (b) with respect to Company RS Awards held by any other person, none of the unvested portion of
such employee’s Company RS Award; and “Company RS Award” means an award of restricted shares of Company Common
Stock that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (including performance-vesting conditions).
•
Each Conversion Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a
cash-based retention award in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to
the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and
requirements). For the purposes of the Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, “Conversion Company RS Award” means
any Company RS Award that is not a Cash-Out Company RS Award.
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the
Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the Inovalon 2015 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”), each participant’s outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate
on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP)
and the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For a further description of the treatment of equity compensation awards, See “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity
Compensation Awards” and “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
•
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers have informed us
that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares
3
Table of Contents
owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13,
2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our stockholders, our directors and executive
officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740 shares of Company
Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. For a further description of the voting intentions of the Company’s directors and executive officers, see
“Special Factors — Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Information about the Special
Meeting — Voting Intentions of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers.”
•
Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting
power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own
approximately 23% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have separately entered into support agreements
with Parent, each dated August 19, 2021, as they may be amended from time to time (the “Support Agreements”), pursuant to which the
Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. However, the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement separately requires an affirmative vote of Public Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, which excludes all shares of Company Common Stock held by Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital. Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy
statement.
•
Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
for US federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-US tax laws. A US Holder who solely receives
cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
Stockholders who are Non-US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) will generally not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless such Non-
US Holder has certain connections to the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on
the stockholder’s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them (including the application of any US federal non-income, state, local and non-US tax laws) of the Merger. For
further information about the material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Material US
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
•
Financing of the Merger. The Merger is not subject to any financing condition. Parent estimates that the total funds necessary to
complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $7,500,000,000. Parent expects this amount to be funded via
approximately $3,175,000,000 from equity investments by Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-RAIF, acting through and represented by
its managing general partner Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL for and on behalf of its compartment Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-

collectively, the “Equity Investors”), approximately $3,000,000,000 from debt financing by specified lenders and approximately
$1,300,000,000 from the Rollover Stockholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Rollover Agreements.
•
Parent has delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of August 19, 2021, entered into by and among Parent and

the terms and conditions contained therein, to

provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of up to $3,175,000,000 to Parent on or prior to the closing of the Merger, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) in connection with the funding of the
transaction. The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the rights granted to Parent under the Equity Commitment Letter (if and only if
the Company is entitled to specific performance of Parent’s obligations to consummate the Merger) solely for the purpose of seeking
specific performance of Parent’s right to cause the Equity Commitment to be funded in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter (solely to the extent that Parent can cause the commitment to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter). For further information about the financing of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”

Blackstone Credit (together with funds and accounts managed or advised by it or its affiliates), Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC
(together with its affiliates and its and their managed funds and accounts), Apollo Global Funding, LLC and Apollo Capital
Management, L.P., on behalf of one or more investment funds, separate accounts and other entities owned (in whole or in part),
controlled, managed and/or advised by it or its affiliates (the “Debt Commitment Parties”) have agreed to provide Parent with debt
financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,000,000,000 on the terms set forth in the debt commitment letter, dated August
19, 2021, executed by the Commitment Parties and accepted by Parent (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). The obligations of the
Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary terms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and certain other customary closing conditions. Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt
financing, the failure of Parent to obtain sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case,
Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee. For further information about the financing of the Merger, see
“Special Factors — Financing of the Merger.”
•
Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a Limited

•
Regulatory Approvals. The Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any successor statute, rules or regulations thereto (the “HSR Act”),
which prevents the parties from completing the Merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. In addition, the Merger is subject to clearance of the Merger by the Committee of
Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which requires that the parties file a declaration and furnish information to CFIUS in
accordance with the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.§ 4565), and its implementing regulations located at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800-
802 (the “CFIUS Authorities”) and receive CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the Merger Agreement). For further information about the
regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger, see “Special Factors — Regulatory Approvals.” Although we expect that all
required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be
timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the Merger not being
satisfied.

or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of

provisions that in the aggregate are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and that
does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to
Parent required pursuant to the Merger Agreement (each, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”)) or require the Company to
abandon, terminate, breach or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (iv) resolve, commit or
agree to do any of the foregoing.
If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal after August 19, 2021 and before the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval (which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement), and the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to (A) furnish non-public information, and afford access
to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations
with such Third Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal, in each case, would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties

discussions and negotiations with such Third Party in respect of the Acquisition Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board and the Special Committee, as applicable, are prohibited from taking certain actions enumerated in the Merger
Agreement that would constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change unless, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) there occurs an Intervening Event or the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial
Advisor) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; (ii) the Company Board (or Special Committee, if applicable) provides Parent with at least three (3) Business Days’
advance written notice that the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company has negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that an
Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary; and (iii) after giving effect to clause (ii), as required, the Company
Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor) that the failure to effect and Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub are qualified
and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is
important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and were
negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the
Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in some
cases were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by the Company, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. The
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement will not survive completion of the Merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter
of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the
Merger Agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may or may not have been included in the
Company’s periodic and current reports, this proxy statement and other documents filed with the SEC. For the foregoing reasons, the representations,
warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information
provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.

Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor

The Special Committee retained Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Special
Committee’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special

Merger. Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders, including Dr. Dunleavy, through
certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their

for the Merger, and their beliefs as to the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Purpose and
Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the

•
Certain Effects of the Merger; Treatment of the Shares. At the time at which the Merger becomes effective, being the time at which a
certificate of merger substantially in the form attached to the Merger Agreement (the “Certificate of Merger”) is filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time and date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties to the
Merger Agreement and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the “Effective Time”), each share of
Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company Class B Common Stock (the “Shares” and, each, a “Share”) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding a portion of the Shares held by the Rollover Stockholders, including certain
Shares held by Dr. Dunleavy and certain of his affiliates and certain holders of Company Class B Common Stock, that will, pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements, each dated August 19, 2021, separately entered in by the Rollover Stockholders and Parent, as they may be
amended from time to time (the “Rollover Agreements”), be exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc., which in turn will be
exchanged for equity interests of Ocala Topco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Rollover Shares”), Shares held by Parent or
Merger Sub (or any of their respective subsidiaries) or in the treasury of the Company (“Cancelled Shares”) and Shares that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that have not been voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and whose holders properly exercise and validly perfect appraisal rights with respect to
such Shares in accordance with, and who comply with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting
2
Table of Contents
Shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to be
outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement. For further information about the treatment of the Shares, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects of the Merger —
Treatment of the Shares.”
•
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a “Company Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an
amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be cancelled
without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Each award of restricted stock units, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (a
“Company RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated
and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Each Cash-Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and
terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS
Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of performance). For the purpose of the
Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, a “Cash-Out Company RS Award” means (a) with respect to Company RS Awards
held by an employee that has signed a release prior to the Closing Date, 30% of any unvested portion of such employee’s
Company RS Award, and (b) with respect to Company RS Awards held by any other person, none of the unvested portion of
such employee’s Company RS Award; and “Company RS Award” means an award of restricted shares of Company Common
Stock that is subject to vesting or forfeiture (including performance-vesting conditions).
•
Each Conversion Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into a
cash-based retention award in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to
the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and
requirements). For the purposes of the Merger Agreement and this proxy statement, “Conversion Company RS Award” means
any Company RS Award that is not a Cash-Out Company RS Award.
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the
Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business
Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the Inovalon 2015 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the “ESPP”), each participant’s outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate
on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP)
and the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Compensation Awards” and “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
•
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers have informed us
that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares
3
Table of Contents
owned directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13,
2021, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our stockholders, our directors and executive
officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740 shares of Company
Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. For a further description of the voting intentions of the Company’s directors and executive officers, see
“Special Factors — Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Information about the Special
Meeting — Voting Intentions of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers.”
•
Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger. The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting
power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own
approximately 23% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have separately entered into support agreements
with Parent, each dated August 19, 2021, as they may be amended from time to time (the “Support Agreements”), pursuant to which the
Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. However, the adoption and approval of the Merger

•
Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger. The exchange of the Shares for cash in the Merger will be a taxable
transaction to US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”)
for US federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local and non-US tax laws. A US Holder who solely receives
cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the cash received by such holder in the Merger and the adjusted tax basis in the Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.
Stockholders who are Non-US Holders (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) will generally not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless such Non-
US Holder has certain connections to the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to a stockholder will depend on
the stockholder’s particular circumstances, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them (including the application of any US federal non-income, state, local and non-US tax laws) of the Merger. For
further information about the material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger, see “Special Factors — Material US
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and certain other customary closing conditions. Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt
financing, the failure of Parent to obtain sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case,
Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee. For further information about the financing of the Merger, see

Regulatory Approvals. The Merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any successor statute, rules or regulations thereto (the “HSR Act”),
which prevents the parties from completing the Merger until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. In addition, the Merger is subject to clearance of the Merger by the Committee of
Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which requires that the parties file a declaration and furnish information to CFIUS in
accordance with the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.§ 4565), and its implementing regulations located at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800-
802 (the “CFIUS Authorities”) and receive CFIUS Clearance (as defined in the Merger Agreement). For further information about the
regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger, see “Special Factors — Regulatory Approvals.” Although we expect that all
required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be
timely obtained or obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or
obligations or enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the Merger not being
satisfied.

Agreement), and the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Special Committee

to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations

under Applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may furnish certain non-public information to and engage in
discussions and negotiations with such Third Party in respect of the Acquisition Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board and the Special Committee, as applicable, are prohibited from taking certain actions enumerated in the Merger
Agreement that would constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change unless, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) there occurs an Intervening Event or the Company Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial
Advisor) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; (ii) the Company Board (or Special Committee, if applicable) provides Parent with at least three (3) Business Days’
advance written notice that the Company intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and, if requested by Parent in good
faith, the Company has negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement so that an
Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be necessary; and (iii) after giving effect to clause (ii), as required, the Company
Board (upon recommendation of the Special Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor) that the failure to effect and Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, all of which
you should read carefully in their entirety. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Q.
Why am I receiving this document?
A.
On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation
surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.” Parent and Merger Sub are entities that are
affiliated with a consortium of private equity investors led by Nordic Capital X. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A
and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
Based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself): (i)
determined and declared that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair, advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and the Public Stockholders and recommended the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Inovalon
stockholders, subject to certain terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement; (ii) approved the Merger Agreement, the terms and conditions
thereof and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and
the Rollover Agreements for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In evaluating the Merger, the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and Special Committee also consulted with the Company’s management, legal and
other advisors (including, in the case of the Special Committee, Evercore) and considered various material factors.
The Company is holding the Special Meeting so that the Inovalon stockholders may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Golden
Parachute Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.
The Company is soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting. You are receiving this proxy statement because you own Shares. This proxy statement
contains important information about the Merger and the Special Meeting, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed proxy card allows you to
vote your Shares without attending the Special Meeting.
Your vote is extremely important, and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. For more information on how to vote your
Shares, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Information about the Special Meeting.”
Q.
What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?
A.
The proposed transaction is the Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
In addition, following completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time and in compliance with Applicable Law, the Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), upon application to the SEC. As a result of the Merger, the Company will no longer be an
independent public company, the Shares will no longer be listed on any exchange or quotation system, price quotations will no longer be available
and the Company’s registration and reporting obligation under the Exchange Act will cease.
12
Table of Contents
Following completion of the Merger, your Shares will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and you will no longer have any interest in the Company’s future earnings, growth or
value.
For more information about the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, see “The Merger Agreement.”
Q.
What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A.
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third
party, the Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the
Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management
will operate the Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that the Company’s stockholders will
continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent that the current
market price of Shares reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. For more information about what happens if the Merger is
not completed, see “Special Factors — Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed.”
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs and, under certain circumstances, reimburse up to $10,000,000 of Parent’s out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs. For more information about termination fees, see “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”
Q.

A.
The Special Meeting of stockholders of the Company will be held virtually via live webcast on November 16, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at

Q.
Who can vote at the Special Meeting?
A.
All record holders of Shares as of the close of business on October 21, 2021, the Record Date, are entitled to notice of, and to virtually attend and

record on the Record Date and each record holder of Company Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Company Class
B Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting.
If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote
by attending the Special Meeting virtually, you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or letter from your
broker, bank or other nominee, along with proper identification. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote by attending the

enough time prior to the Special Meeting to obtain this proxy from the holder of record.
For more information about who can vote at the Special Meeting, see “Information about the Special Meeting — Voting.”
Q.
What is the difference between being a “stockholder of record” and a “beneficial owner” of Shares held in “street name”?
A.
If your Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,
with respect to those Shares, the stockholder of record or record holder. This proxy statement
13
Table of Contents
and proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly
to us or to vote by attending the Special Meeting virtually.
If your Shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those Shares held in “street name.” In
that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those Shares,
the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your Shares
by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting virtually. However, since you are not the stockholder
of record, you may not vote these Shares electronically at the virtual Special Meeting unless you provide a legal proxy from your broker, bank or
other nominee.
For more information about the stockholders of record and beneficial owners of Shares held in “street name,” see “Information about the Special
Meeting — Voting.”

Company Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” for a discussion of the factors that the Special Committee and the Company
Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) considered in deciding to recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement. See also
“Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger.”
Q.
How will the Rollover Stockholders vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal?
A.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting power of
the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own approximately 23% of the
voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, separately entered into Support Agreements with Parent.
Under the Support Agreements, the Rollover Stockholders agreed to vote their Shares in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Support Agreement. The obligations of the Rollover Stockholders under the Support Agreements will automatically terminate upon the earliest to
occur of: (i) the mutual agreement of the parties thereto to terminate the applicable Support Agreement; (ii) the End Date; (iii) the Effective Time;
and (iv) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In the event the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change, in compliance with the Merger Agreement, prior to the Company’s receipt
of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the obligation of the Rollover Stockholders to vote the Shares listed in the Support Agreements
as described above will be modified such that the Rollover Stockholders will each have the right to so vote (x) in favor of the Merger or (y) such
proportion of Shares as votes cast by the Inovalon stockholders other than the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as
applicable, with respect to the applicable matter (such proportion determined without the inclusion of the votes cast by the Dunleavy Entities, Mr.
André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as applicable).
Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B to the proxy statement and are incorporated by reference in the proxy statement in its
entirety. For more information about the voting intentions of the Rollover Stockholders, see “Special Factors — Intent of the Rollover
Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger” and “Special Factors — Support Agreement.”
Q.
How do I vote?
A.
If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date, you may vote your Shares on matters presented at the Special Meeting in any of the
following ways:
•
by attending the Special Meeting virtually and casting your vote electronically;
•
by proxy (stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy);
•
on the Internet, by following the Internet proxy instructions printed on the enclosed proxy card;
•
by telephone, using the telephone number printed on the enclosed proxy card; or
•
by mail, by marking the enclosed proxy card, dating and signing it, and returning it in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.
If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive
instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your Shares voted. Those instructions will identify
which of the above choices are available to you in order to have your Shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote
electronically by attending the Special Meeting virtually, you must have a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee naming you as the
proxy. You should allow yourself enough time prior to the Special Meeting to obtain this proxy from the holder of record.
The control number located on your proxy card is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a proxy for your Shares, and to confirm
that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone in advance of the Special
Meeting.
Please refer to the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form to determine the deadlines for submitting a proxy over the Internet or
by telephone in advance of the Special Meeting. If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card must be received by
our Corporate Secretary by the time the Special Meeting begins.

For more information about voting, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”
Q.
What is a proxy?
A.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your Shares. This written document describing the matters to be considered and voted
on at the Special Meeting is called a proxy statement. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your Shares is called a proxy card. For more
information about voting by proxy, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”
Q.
If I am a stockholder of record, what happens if I do not vote or submit a proxy card?
A.
If you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either electronically at the virtual Special Meeting or by proxy, your Shares will not be
voted at the Special Meeting and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Additionally, if you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, electronically at the virtual Special Meeting or by proxy, your failure to vote
will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, with respect to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative
vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of Inovalon’s outstanding common stock, voting as a single class; (ii) a majority of outstanding
Company Class A Common Stock; (iii) a majority of outstanding Class B Common Stock; and (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding
common stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public Stockholders; and (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as a
quorum is present) or the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present). For more information, see “Information about the
Special Meeting.”
Q.
If my Shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my Shares for me?
A.
Your broker, bank or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Shares if you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote.
You should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding the voting of your Shares. Under applicable stock
exchange rules, absent your instructions, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on “non-routine” matters
and all of the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting are, under such rules, “non-routine.” As a result, absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of such Shares, your broker, bank or other nominee is not empowered to vote such Shares.
If you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on at least one, but not all of the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting,
your Shares will be voted according to your instructions on those proposals for which you have provided instructions and will be counted as
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. In this scenario, a “broker non-vote” will occur with
respect to each other proposal for which you did not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.
A failure to provide instructions with respect to any of the proposals or a broker non-vote will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval thresholds requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding Company Common Stock; (ii) a majority of outstanding Company Class A Common Stock; (iii) a majority of outstanding Company
Class B Common Stock; or (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public
Stockholders; (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal; and (c) have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a
quorum is present). For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — Voting.”
Q.
If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the Shares voted?
A.
If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit a proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, and each of them,
with full power of substitution, will vote your Shares in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes or
the proxy card, you may specify whether your Shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or to “ABSTAIN” from voting on, all, some or none
of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly execute your proxy card but do not mark the boxes indicating how your Shares should be voted on a matter, the Shares represented
by your properly executed proxy will be voted “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, “FOR” the Golden Parachute Proposal and “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal. For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”

Table of Contents
Q.
Can I change or revoke my vote?
A.
Yes. You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised, by (i)
submitting another proxy, including a proxy card, at a later date by telephone or on the Internet or by timely delivery of a validly executed, later-
dated proxy; (ii) giving written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, which must be filed with our Corporate Secretary before the Special
Meeting begins; or (iii) attending the Special Meeting virtually and voting electronically. If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of
Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, please refer to the information forwarded by your broker, bank or other
nominee for procedures on revoking your proxy.
Only your last submitted proxy will be considered. Please cast your vote “FOR” each of the proposals, following the instructions set forth on your
enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, as promptly as possible. For more information, see
“Information about the Special Meeting — Proxies and Revocation.”
Q.
What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A.
If, as of the Record Date, you hold Shares as the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name,” or through more than one broker, bank or other
nominee, and also directly as the stockholder of record or otherwise, you may receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction forms relating
to the Special Meeting. These should each be executed and returned separately in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy
statement in order to ensure that all of your Shares are voted.
Q.
Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
A.
No. After the Merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with detailed written instructions for exchanging your Shares for the
Merger Consideration. If, as of the Record Date, you are the beneficial owner of Shares held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other
nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of
your Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Please do not send in your certificates now.
Q.
What happens if I sell my Shares before the Special Meeting?
A.
The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is prior to both the date of the Special Meeting and the consummation of
the Merger. If you transfer your Shares before the Record Date, you will not be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and will not be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. If you transfer your Shares after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting you will, unless special
arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting, but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person
to whom you transfer your Shares. Unless special arrangements are made, the person to whom you transfer your Shares after the Record Date will
not have a right to vote those Shares at the Special Meeting. For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — How to Vote.”
Q.
Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A.
The Company has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. The Company has agreed to
pay MacKenzie Partners, Inc. a fee of approximately $50,000 – $75,000, and to reimburse MacKenzie Partners, Inc. for certain out-of-pocket fees,
charges and expenses. The Company will indemnify MacKenzie Partners, Inc. and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and
expenses. The Company also will reimburse brokers, banks, other nominees, custodians and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of the
Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of our Shares and in obtaining voting instructions from those
owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, over the Internet or in person. Our
directors, officers and employees will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies. For more information, see “Information about the
Special Meeting — Solicitation of Proxies; Payment of Solicitation Expenses.”
Q.
What is householding and how does it affect me?
A.
The SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers, banks and other nominees to satisfy delivery requirements with respect to two
or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement.
18
Table of Contents
This process is commonly referred to as “householding” and can result in significant cost savings for the Company. To take advantage of this
opportunity, the Company, brokers, banks and other nominees who hold your Shares may deliver only one proxy statement to multiple stockholders
who share an address unless one or more of the stockholders has provided contrary instructions. The Company will deliver promptly, upon written
or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.
For more information, see “Information about the Special Meeting — Householding of the Proxy Statement.”
Q:
What rights do I have to seek an appraisal of my Shares?
A.
Each holder of Shares will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of such holder’s Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, but only if such holder does not vote such Shares in favor of a Merger Agreement Proposal and otherwise complies with the statutory
requirements and procedures for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which is the appraisal rights
statute applicable to Delaware corporations. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements and procedures will result in the loss of
appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex F to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
The requirements and procedures are also summarized in this proxy statement. For more information about appraisal rights, see “Information about
the Special Meeting — Dissenters’ Rights” and Annex F to this proxy statement.
Q.
What are the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a US Holder?
A.
If you are a US Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), receipt of cash in
exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. Generally, you will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your Shares. However, the tax
consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how
the Merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section below “Special Factors — Material
US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
Q.
What are the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me if I am a Non-US Holder?
A.
If you are a Non-US Holder (as defined below in “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”), you
generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the Merger unless you have certain connections to
the United States. However, the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your
own tax advisors to determine how the Merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the tax consequences of the Merger, see the section
below “Special Factors — Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the Merger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to, the Merger Agreement. You may obtain additional information without charge as described in the section titled “Where You

We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated

Background of the Merger
The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not
purport to catalogue every conversation of or among members of the Special Committee, the Company Board, the Company’s representatives, Nordic
Capital X, Nordic Capital X’s representatives and advisors, and other parties. Other than as described below, there have been no material contacts
between the Company and Nordic Capital X in the past two years.
The Company Board, together with the Company’s management and with the assistance of the Company’s advisors, has periodically reviewed and
assessed the Company’s operations, financial performance, competitive position, and growth opportunities in the context of the Company’s long-term
strategic goals and plans. The Company Board, together with the Company’s management, regularly reviews potential opportunities to enhance
stockholder value and considers various strategic alternatives.
Beginning in September 2019, the Company Board, together with the Company’s management, commenced a detailed strategic review that included
an assessment of the Company’s operations, financial performance, leverage profile, competitive position, new product innovation opportunities, and
long-term plans and an exploration of potential opportunities to further strengthen the Company’s market position and enhance stockholder value,
including various alternatives to help achieve its plans such as raising equity or convertible debt, refinancing existing debt, add-on acquisitions, joint
ventures, collaborations and business combinations. In connection with this strategic review, the Company Board was briefed on contacts from various
potential strategic partners and the ensuing discussions of potential future opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships, but
none of these discussions led to any specific proposals.
In connection with this strategic review and as part of the Company Board’s ongoing governance and review practices, the Nominating &
Corporate Governance Committee of the Company Board sought advice from outside counsel regarding fiduciary duties of directors, appropriate
approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a director is a large stockholder, including the
circumstances in which it would be prudent to form a special committee of independent directors. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee
requested that outside counsel prepare a memorandum summarizing its advice, which was presented and discussed extensively at the regularly-
scheduled meeting of the Company Board on June 17, 2020.
On August 27, 2020, the management presented to the Company Board an overview of the Company’s capital structure, which included a
discussion of potential sources of strategic capital and other methods to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. The Company Board
instructed management to continue its review of sources of strategic capital and strategies for helping the Company to further accelerate and expand the
achievement of its corporate objectives and mission.
On November 11, 2020, a Managing Partner at a private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm A”) contacted Keith R. Dunleavy, the Company’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, via e-mail to inquire about whether the Company would be interested in a potential transaction between PE Firm A
and the Company. On December 2, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy held a videoconference with representatives of PE Firm A to discuss PE Firm A’s expression of
interest. Following this telephone conference, on December 4, 2020, Dr. Dunleavy informed William L. Teuber, Jr., the current lead independent director of
the
21
Table of Contents
Company Board, of PE Firm A’s indication of interest and informed Mr. Teuber that he would keep him and the Company Board informed of future
developments with respect to PE Firm A. Following the December 2 discussion, there were no further communications between PE Firm A and the
Company, its management or the Company Board until May 2021 (as described below).
On February 1, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy was introduced to an Executive Vice President of a large technology company (referred to as “Company A”) to
discuss future opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between Company A and the Company.
On February 11, 2021, during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy provided an overview of various debt and equity
financings undertaken by peer group companies in the technology and healthcare industries and other strategic transactions announced by such peer
group companies. The members of the Company Board discussed various strategic alternatives with management, including raising additional capital to
fund acquisitions and research and development via an offering of additional equity or convertible debt or an expansion of the Company’s revolving
credit facility, strategic partnerships, and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate achievement of its corporate objectives and mission.
Dr. Dunleavy also provided an overview of his engagement with PE Firm A and Company A to date (as described above). The independent members of
the Company Board then met in executive session. Following this discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized management to
engage in discussions with financial advisors who could potentially assist the Company Board with an exploration of various strategic alternatives,
including methods for raising strategic capital. At this time, the Company Board and management were focused on the evaluation of potential capital
markets and debt transactions, but the Company Board nonetheless specifically instructed management to select a financial advisor who would be
capable of advising on any and all potential strategic alternative transactions being considered.
From mid-March 2021 to mid-April 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in several follow-up conversations with representatives of Company A to further
discuss opportunities for strategic partnerships, commercial arrangements or other transactions between the Company and Company A. On April 14,
2021, Dr. Dunleavy and five (5) additional members of the Company’s executive and senior management participated in a videoconference with
representatives of Company A during which the Company and Company A discussed the Company’s data, connectivity, analytical, and broader cloud
platform capabilities, as well as potential strategic opportunities for the two companies to partner in the future.
On April 20, 2021, Daniel Berglund, a Partner at one of the entities that provides advice and makes recommendations to the investment manager of
Nordic Capital X (collectively, the “Nordic Capital Advisors”), arranged for an introduction via email to Dr. Dunleavy.
On May 3, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented a preliminary evaluation of the Company’s financial position and
leverage profile, an assessment of market conditions generally and a preliminary comparison of the Company to other peer group companies. At the
meeting J.P. Morgan discussed its views on various potential strategic alternatives, including capital markets transactions, a refinancing of the
Company’s revolving credit facility, strategic partnerships, a sale of the Company and additional strategies for helping the Company accelerate and
achieve its corporate objectives and mission. After extensive discussion, the Company Board concluded that the Company’s management should explore
potential market interest in an acquisition of the Company before proceeding with any capital markets or debt transactions due to the potentially dilutive
effect of such transactions on stockholder value. Dr. Dunleavy stated that, should the Company explore a sale, Dr. Dunleavy would only support a
transaction as a stockholder in which all stockholders received the same amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company
Board then met in executive session. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the
engagement of J.P. Morgan in order for J.P. Morgan to pursue a multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential equity offering facilitated by one or more
investment banks, (ii) a potential increase in the Company’s current credit line or revolver or both, and (iii) the initial exploration and assessment of
potential strategic partnerships that could further accelerate the Company’s achievement of its corporate objectives and mission, as well as a potential
sale of the Company. J.P. Morgan was selected by management and the Company Board based, in part, on J.P. Morgan’s qualifications, expertise and
reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company’s industry and its ability to manage a multi-track process that
involved exploration of multiple strategic alternatives in parallel.
On May 18, 2021, the Company hosted a virtual investor day in which members of the Company’s management presented a detailed overview of the
Company’s vision, growth strategy, markets, cloud-based platform capabilities, and financial information, including earnings guidance for fiscal year 2021.
Members of the public were invited to attend the virtual investor day, and a replay of the event, as well as a copy of all presentation materials, were
posted to the Company’s website following the event.

During the period from early May 2021 through July 2021, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company’s
management, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted over 20 potential counterparties, including PE Firm A and Company A and other potential strategic
counterparties and financial sponsors (but not including Nordic Capital X), to gauge their interest in potential transactions with the Company, including a
sale of the Company. J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company Board and under the oversight of the Company’s management, informed each party
that any proposals involving an acquisition of the Company should be structured such that all of the Company’s stockholders receive the same amount
and type of consideration. The Company entered into 13 confidentiality agreements (all but one of which contained standstills) with interested parties,
including PE Firm A and Company A. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, along with Dr. Dunleavy and Jonathan Boldt, Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, participated in management meetings with 13 of the parties that signed confidentiality agreements to provide further information regarding the
Company and its financial performance. Among the parties, three large technology companies (including Company A, with the latter two referred to as
“Company B” and “Company C”) conveyed interest in an acquisition or strategic partnership with the Company.
On May 26, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy participated in a videoconference with multiple representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors, including Mr.
Berglund and Fredrik Näslund, during which they mentioned that Nordic Capital X may be interested in exploring an acquisition of the Company.
On June 4, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a
private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm B”) containing a summary of terms under which PE Firm B would be interested in acquiring the Company. J.P.
Morgan had not included PE Firm B in their initial outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, and prior to receiving PE Firm B’s
indication of interest, neither J.P. Morgan nor the Company had any discussions with PE Firm B regarding strategic transactions or a potential
acquisitions of the Company. PE Firm B’s letter included a valuation range of $36.00 to $39.00 per share, payable in cash. On the basis of the non-binding
indication of interest, Dr. Dunleavy instructed J.P. Morgan to invite PE Firm B to execute a confidentiality agreement and commence due diligence on the
Company. On June 6, 2021, PE Firm B executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On June 8, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm A.
PE Firm A’s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $35.00 per share in cash, subject to
further due diligence and negotiations.
On June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from a private
equity firm participating in the process based on J.P. Morgan’s original outreach to financial sponsors (referred to as “PE Firm C”). PE Firm C’s indication
of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $34.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due
diligence and negotiations.
On June 9, 2021, J.P. Morgan received an updated non-binding indication of interest addressed to Dr. Dunleavy and the Company from PE Firm B.
PE Firm B’s letter included a valuation range of $38.00 to $40.00 per share, payable in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash
consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity.
On June 9, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan presented an update on the Company’s multi-track exploration of: (i) a potential
equity offering facilitated by one or more investment banks; (ii) a potential increase in the Company’s current credit line or revolver or both; and (iii)
interest in a strategic partnership with or acquisition of the Company sought via outreach to various potential acquirers of the Company, including public
companies and private equity firms. J.P. Morgan also presented a preliminary summary of valuation perspectives on the Company, including historical
trading data and equity value per share derived from trading multiples, transaction multiples and a discounted cash flow analysis. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan also provided an update on: (i) the three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C,
respectively, all of which remained subject to various contingencies, including ongoing diligence of the Company and continued engagement with
Company management, and (ii) continuing engagement with several large technology companies (including Company B and Company C).
Representatives of J.P. Morgan also informed the Company Board that Company A had indicated that it would no longer be participating in the process.
Dr. Dunleavy reiterated his commitment to support potential sale transactions as a stockholder only if all of the Company’s stockholders received the
same amount and type of consideration. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive session. Following the presentation and
ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board authorized the engagement of Latham & Watkins LLP (referred to as “Latham &
Watkins”) as legal counsel to the Company in connection with its exploration of, among other options, a potential equity offering and/or
23
Table of Contents
refinancing of its revolving credit facility and a potential sale of the Company or strategic partnership with the Company. The Company Board selected
Latham & Watkins based, in part, on its experience representing companies engaged in a multi-track strategic alternatives review that could involve one
or more capital markets and M&A transactions.
On June 11, 2021, the Company retained Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Company.
On June 17, 2021, at a meeting of the Company Board, Dr. Dunleavy presented an update on the three preliminary, non-binding indications of
interest received from PE Firm A, PE Firm B, and PE Firm C. Dr. Dunleavy informed the Company Board that: (i) PE Firm A had informed J.P. Morgan that it
was unwilling to increase the price per share from what was included in its original indication of interest and (ii) PE Firm B was continuing its due
diligence review of the Company. Additionally, Dr. Dunleavy informed the board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, and the
Company’s management continued to engage with several large companies in the software and technology industries (including Company B and
Company C) regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of the Company. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive
session. Following the presentation and ensuing discussion and executive session, the Company Board instructed the Company’s management to
continue its exploration of potential strategic alternatives for the Company.
During the period from mid-June through mid-July 2021, the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the
Company’s management, continued discussions with Company B and Company C. While both companies initially expressed interest in potentially
acquiring the Company, both later determined that they would instead be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential
bidders.
To date, J.P. Morgan had not included Nordic Capital X in its outreach to strategic counterparties and financial sponsors. In late June 2021, based
on the preliminary conversation held between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (as described above), Dr. Dunleavy
instructed J.P. Morgan to reach out to Nordic Capital X and invite it to participate in the ongoing strategic alternatives review. On June 24, 2021, Nordic
Capital X executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On July 1, 2021, PE Firm B submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest revising its proposed price to $38.00 per share in cash. At the
direction of the Company’s management and based on discussions of the Company Board at the meeting held on June 17, 2021, J.P. Morgan informed PE
Firm B that it would need to increase its proposed price per share in order to proceed in the process. PE Firm B responded that it would not increase its
price, and that representatives of J.P. Morgan should notify it if circumstances change and there was an opportunity to move forward at PE Firm B’s
proposed price.
On July 2, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with the CEO of a company in the healthcare industry (referred to as “Company D”) to discuss the capabilities
and industry vision of the Company. Based on the initial discussion, the parties agreed to meet again on July 3, 2021. During a follow-up discussion
between Dr. Dunleavy and the CEO of Company D on July 12, 2021, the CEO of Company D expressed an interest in exploring an acquisition of the
Company. On July 13, 2021, Company D executed a confidentiality agreement (which contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.
On July 5, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy met with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors (including Kristoffer Melinder, Mr. Naslund and Mr.
Berglund) in person to discuss a potential transaction in which Nordic Capital X would acquire the Company. Detailed terms of the potential transaction
(including price and structure) were not discussed, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors indicated that Nordic Capital X would follow up
with a written indication of interest. During the meeting, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors observed that, in transactions of a similar size and
assuming an advanced stage of discussions, Nordic Capital X would typically request that members of management participate in a rollover of their
investment. Dr. Dunleavy stated that he could not consider any rollover at this point but he understood Nordic Capital Advisors’ position, and he would
only be willing to discuss the matter further if Nordic Capital X’s rollover proposal was supported by the Company Board.
On July 6, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy received an unsolicited email from an additional private equity firm (referred to as “PE Firm D”) expressing an interest
submitting an indication of interest in acquiring the Company. Dr. Dunleavy forwarded the email to representatives of J.P. Morgan, who, at the direction of
the Company’s management, invited PE Firm D to participate in the sale process. On July 7, 2021, PE Firm D executed a confidentiality agreement (which
contained a standstill) and commenced due diligence.

On July 12, 2021, J.P. Morgan received a written preliminary, non-binding indication of interest from Nordic Capital X addressed to the Company
Board. Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest outlined a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $43.00 per share in
cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Nordic Capital X’s
indication of interest expressly stated that it was not contingent on any member of management participating in a rollover of their holdings and also
expressly stated that, if the contemplated equity financing for the transaction were to include any material participation by the Company’s significant
stockholders, then Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest was conditioned on (1) the Company Board forming a special committee of independent
directors to consider Nordic Capital X’s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board and indicated
that Nordic Capital X would not move forward with their proposal unless it is recommended by such a special committee, and (2) adoption of the Merger
Agreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such significant shareholders. The indication of interest
requested that the Company enter into an exclusivity agreement with Nordic Capital X for a period of up to four weeks in order for Nordic Capital X to
complete its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement, which request for exclusivity was not granted by the Company or the Company Board.
On July 13, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &
Watkins to discuss the indication of interest received from Nordic Capital X and the preliminary outreach from PE Firm D. J.P. Morgan advised the Board
that PE Firm D indicated verbally that it was prepared to submit a preliminary, non-binding indication of interest in the low $40 per share, payable in cash,
but that PE Firm D would require an additional six weeks to complete its due diligence review of the Company. Additionally, J.P. Morgan informed the
Company Board that J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, and the Company’s management continued to seek out and engage
with other potential buyers or strategic partners of the Company, including companies in the software and technology industries, and while no other
party had submitted an indication of interest in acquiring the Company, certain potential strategic partners (including Company B and Company C)
suggested that they would be interested in participating in an equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. The Company Board discussed the
possibility of requesting that Nordic increase its offer price to $44.00 per share and provide further details on its sources of debt and equity financing in
exchange for the Company accepting its request for a period of exclusivity. The Company Board also discussed the likelihood that Nordic Capital X may
request that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion of his shareholding in the Company in light of the Company Board’s understanding of
typical market practices for financial sponsors and the statements made during the July 5 meeting between Dr. Dunleavy and representatives of the
Nordic Capital Advisors and in Nordic Capital X’s July 12, 2021 indication of interest with regard to a rollover. After extensive discussions with J.P.
Morgan and Latham & Watkins, including regarding its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a possible acquisition or merger and appropriate
approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest as originally discussed by the Company Board in June 2020 after consultation with
outside counsel, the Company Board decided to form a special committee of the Company Board in the event that Nordic Capital X proposed transaction
terms that would include Dr. Dunleavy or any affiliate of the Company receiving different consideration than the Public Stockholders. The Company
Board also authorized J.P. Morgan and the Company’s management to continue discussions with Nordic Capital X and propose a price of $44.00 per share
in exchange for the Company considering entering into an exclusivity agreement. The Company Board instructed Latham & Watkins to prepare a form of
exclusivity agreement that could be used in the event that the Company Board decided to accommodate Nordic Capital X’s request for exclusivity.
On July 14, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted to J.P. Morgan an updated, written non-binding indication of interest addressed to the Company
Board outlining a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders would receive $44.00 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence,
which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including equity that Nordic Capital X expected to raise from third parties.
While the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a potential rollover by members of the Company’s management or the
Company’s significant stockholders, the indication of interest again expressly conditioned any rollover structure on (1) the Company Board forming a
special committee to consider Nordic Capital X’s proposal and such special committee making a favorable recommendation to the Company Board, and (2)
adoption of the Merger Agreement by a fully informed vote of a majority of shareholders who are not affiliated with such shareholders participating in
such rollover (the “Approval Conditions”). The updated indication of interest reiterated Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations.
On July 14, PE Firm D informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that it would no longer be participating in the process.
On July 15, 2021, in response to Nordic Capital X’s updated indication of interest, representatives of J.P. Morgan shared a draft exclusivity
agreement that was prepared by Latham & Watkins with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors.
On July 15, 2021, representatives of Company D participated in a management presentation with Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to provide information
regarding the Company and its financial performance.

On July 16, 2021, representatives from Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, outside counsel for the
investment manager of Nordic Capital X (referred to here as “Kirkland & Ellis”) in which the parties discussed process matters and due diligence
information. During this call representatives of Latham & Watkins and Kirkland & Ellis discussed the fact that the Company Board was meeting soon to
consider and approve the establishment of a special committee and also that they would each expect the special committee would need to evaluate
whether the Company should enter into any exclusivity arrangement with Nordic Capital X.
On July 18, 2021, the CEO of Company D informed Dr. Dunleavy that Company D would require at least 90 days to complete its due diligence review
of the Company and was therefore was not able to submit an indication of interest on a timeline that would be competitive with other potential bidders.
However, the CEO of Company D noted that it would be interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders in an
amount up to $500 million, and Company D planned to continue its due diligence review in order to potentially participate in such an investment.
On July 18, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by the Company’s management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Latham &
Watkins to discuss and receive an update on discussions with Nordic Capital X and other potential acquirers and strategic partners. Based on
discussions that occurred following the July 13, 2021 meeting of the Company Board, J.P. Morgan indicated that they were increasingly confident that
Nordic Capital X would be able to assemble an equity financing consortium to support a $3.5 billion equity commitment and secure $3 billion of debt
financing commitments that was outlined in its most recent indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also noted that Company D had stated it expected to
participate in the equity financing consortium of other potential bidders. While the updated indication of interest did not include any discussion of a
potential rollover by members of the Company’s management or the Company’s significant stockholders, the Company Board again discussed the
possibility that Nordic Capital X may request that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover and determined that such a request from Nordic Capital X was
reasonably likely. Accordingly, representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties in considering proposals for a
possible acquisition or merger, appropriate approaches to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, as well as specific considerations when a
director is a large stockholder. Following extensive discussions with its legal and financial advisors and consistent with its discussions on June 17, 2020
and July 13, 2021, the independent members of the Company Board unanimously passed resolutions, effective as of July 18, 2021, to form the Special
Committee, with Mr. Teuber, William D. Green and Mark A. Pulido as its members. The Company Board determined each member of the Special Committee
to be unaffiliated with, and otherwise independent from, Dr. Dunleavy and to be otherwise independent and disinterested with respect to the Special
Committee’s mandate. The Special Committee was delegated the full power and authority of the Company Board to review, evaluate and negotiate
potential strategic alternatives, including the power to reject one or more proposals and not engage in any transaction, to retain its own advisors and to
make a recommendation to the Company Board regarding any such transaction. The resolution also provided that the Company Board would not
recommend any potential transaction to the Company’s stockholders without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. Dr. Dunleavy
expressed his full support for the establishment of the Special Committee while abstaining from the vote itself.
On July 20, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss, among other topics,
organizational matters to facilitate the Special Committee’s work, including the election of Mr. Teuber as its chairman. After discussion and deliberation,
the Special Committee approved the selection of Latham & Watkins as legal counsel to the Special Committee. The Special Committee selected Latham &
Watkins based, in part, on their industry knowledge and experience, experience representing special committees in circumstances similar to that of the
Special Committee and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company’s management (including Dr. Dunleavy) and Nordic Capital X. The Special
Committee determined that, although Latham & Watkins had been retained in June 2021 as counsel to the Company, Latham & Watkins was not the
Company’s historic counsel and was independent of Company management and Dr. Dunleavy. Additionally, the Special Committee approved the
selection of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP (referred to as “Morris Nichols”) as special Delaware counsel to the Special Committee based, in part,
on their experience with matters of Delaware Law and the absence of conflicts of interest with the Company’s management and potential bidders. The
Special Committee also discussed the various potential financial advisors that the Special Committee would consider for engagement as independent
financial advisors to the Special Committee. After discussing multiple potential financial advisors to the Special Committee, the Special Committee
directed Mr. Teuber to work with Latham & Watkins to contact Evercore and another experienced financial advisor with a national reputation to present
their credentials to the Special Committee. The Special Committee also discussed the Company’s efforts through J.P. Morgan to seek out and engage with
potential strategic and private equity acquirers of the Company, the projections that were prepared by management of the Company and Nordic Capital
X’s most recent indication of interest. The Special Committee noted Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and the fact that a
draft form of exclusivity agreement had previously been shared with Nordic Capital X. The Special Committee determined that it would not authorize the
Company
26
Table of Contents
to enter into an exclusivity agreement until Nordic Capital X provided greater clarity on its sources of financing necessary to support the economic terms
outlined in its indication of interest, including any contemplated rollover by members of management and significant stockholders. The Special Committee
authorized Latham & Watkins to contact Kirkland & Ellis to inform them of the decision.
Following the Special Committee meeting, representatives of Latham & Watkins participated in a call with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis in
which Latham & Watkins confirmed to Kirkland & Ellis that the Company Board had formed the Special Committee and that the Special Committee would
need to authorize and approve any exclusivity agreement.
On July 21, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors requested (via J.P. Morgan) that Dr. Dunleavy participate in a rollover of a portion
of his investment in the Company. On the same date, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee of this request and indicated that he would be willing
to consider a potential rollover of some portion of investment in the Company if discussions with Nordic Capital X were to progress favorably and if the
Special Committee was supportive of Nordic Capital X’s indication of interest. Dr. Dunleavy also indicated that be believed that Mr. Andre Hoffmann (a
holder of Company Class A Shares and a beneficial interest in the Company Class B Shares held by Cape Capital) would be willing to consider a potential
rollover of some portion of Cape Capital’s investment in the Company. Following deliberations, the Special Committee determined that it was unlikely that
Nordic Capital X would proceed with the acquisition without securing a rollover commitment from Dr. Dunleavy. Accordingly, based on the Special
Committee’s understanding that Nordic Capital X would not proceed with a transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy participated in a rollover, the Special
Committee authorized Dr. Dunleavy to commence preliminary negotiations with Nordic Capital X regarding a potential rollover of a portion of Dr.
Dunleavy’s and Cape Capital’s investment in the Company.
On July 22, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended at various times by representatives of Evercore and another experienced financial
advisor to further evaluate each financial advisor’s capabilities. During the portion of the meeting attended by representatives of Evercore, the Special
Committee inquired about any material relationships that Evercore may have with the Company or potential counterparties that may impair its
independence. Evercore confirmed that it had no material relationships with the Company and committed to delivering a written memorandum
summarizing its material relationships with potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy. Following the presentations by
Evercore and the other potential financial advisor, the members of the Special Committee and representatives of Latham & Watkins had further
discussions about the qualifications, experience and independence (including any material relationships with the Company and potential counterparties,
including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy, disclosed by each financial advisor during the meeting) of each potential financial advisor, and the financial
analyses and other actions to be performed by the Special Committee’s financial advisor. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee
directed Mr. Teuber working with Latham & Watkins to obtain engagement proposals from each potential financial advisor.
On July 23, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Latham & Watkins to discuss the engagement proposals and
presentations of each potential financial advisor to the Special Committee. After discussion and deliberation, the Special Committee approved the
selection of Evercore as independent financial advisor to the Special Committee, based in part on Evercore’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its
knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the Company’s industry and take-private transactions generally, its knowledge of the Company’s
business and affairs. The Special Committee directed Mr. Teuber to communicate the engagement selection to Evercore that day and have them
commence work. The Special Committee entered into an engagement letter with Evercore on August 10, 2021.
On July 23, 2021, the CEO of Company D called representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Dr. Dunleavy to inform each of them that
Company D was no longer interested in participating in the equity financing consortium of other bidders and would instead focus on other initiatives.
On July 25, 2021, at a meeting of the Special Committee attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins, J.P. Morgan
presented a detailed preliminary summary of the bidder outreach conducted and indications of interest received to date and the criteria used to seek out
these potential bidders. After J.P. Morgan left the meeting, the Special Committee discussed the presentation and its overall assessment of bidder
outreach extensively with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins.
In late July 2021 and August 2021, the Special Committee held a total of 23 meetings with its advisors in which they discussed updates on the sale
process, the due diligence being conducted by Nordic, the Company’s management’s financial forecast, Evercore’s preliminary financial analyses of the
Company, the Company’s management’s proposal regarding treatment of equity incentives for employees, and key issues in a draft Merger Agreement
and ancillary documents. All

meetings included discussion among the members of the Special Committee with representatives of Latham & Watkins. During these meetings, the
Special Committee again discussed Nordic Capital X’s request for a period of exclusive negotiations and determined that no period of exclusivity would
be granted unless Nordic Capital X provided detailed information on sources of financing. Additionally, the Special Committee and its advisors discussed
the proposed terms of a Merger Agreement that would be provided to Nordic Capital X. The draft expressly stated that in addition to the stockholder
vote required by Delaware law, the Special Committee would, consistent with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposals, further require that the majority of Public
Stockholders also approve the transaction. The Special Committee and its advisors discussed that this so-called “majority of the minority” vote would,
consistent with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposals, be a non-waivable condition for the transaction, and that such vote requirement would also be
communicated to Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital in the event they agreed to roll over any of their shares of the Company. Additionally, the Special
Committee and its advisors discussed various provisions in the Merger Agreement that were designed to maximize value and certainty for the Public
Stockholders, including a “go shop” that would allow the Company to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive
Merger Agreement.
During this same period, following the discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors that were authorized by the Special
Committee on July 21, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he had originally indicated to Nordic Capital X that, if the Special
Committee was supportive of Nordic Capital X’s proposal to acquire the Company, that he would be willing to consider participating in a rollover in an
amount up to $400 million, but representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors had informed him that Nordic Capital X would not be likely to proceed with
a transaction unless Dr. Dunleavy increased the proposed size of his rollover to $700 million. Dr. Dunleavy also informed the Special Committee that Mr.
Hoffmann would be willing to consider coordinating a rollover by Cape Capital in an amount up to $300 million. The Special Committee authorized Dr.
Dunleavy to negotiate with Nordic Capital X about the size of his and Cape Capital’s rollover and to initiate negotiations regarding agreements relating to
the rollover arrangements, subject to the Special Committee’s review and approval. Members of the Special Committee also recommended that Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital retain independent legal advisors.
On July 26, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2021-2023 financial projections for the
Company prepared by management (the “Projections”) and the assumptions underlying such Projections. Also in attendance were representatives of
Latham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the Projections and confirmed that such
Projections were consistent with metrics used in ordinary-course quarterly presentations to the Company Board and the guidance shared with the public
during the May 18 2021 virtual investor day. Mr. Boldt also confirmed that the Projections were consistent with the diligence materials shared with Nordic
Capital X and all other potential bidders and strategic partners. After extensive discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved
the Projections for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore. During this meeting, the members of the Special Committee and
Latham & Watkins updated the independent directors of the Board who are not on the Special Committee about the analyses and activities undertaken by
the Special Committee.
On July 26, 2021, the Special Committee with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, discussed the process of evaluating
alternatives, Nordic Capital X’s due diligence and the projections presented by the Company’s management at the Company Board meeting earlier in the
day.
On July 27, 2021, Bloomberg published an article reporting that Nordic Capital X was in discussions to acquire the Company. In light of the
preliminary stage of negotiations and the absence of specific details, neither the Company nor Nordic Capital X issued a comment on the Bloomberg
article.
On July 28, 2021, representatives of J.P. Morgan transmitted to the Company Board a written memorandum disclosing J.P. Morgan’s material
relationships with respect to the Company and Nordic Capital X.
On July 29, 2021, representatives of Evercore transmitted to the Special Committee a written memorandum disclosing Evercore’s material
relationships with respect to several potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy.
On July 30, 2021, Dr. Dunleavy informed the Special Committee that he, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital had retained Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP
(referred to as “Morgan Lewis”) as their legal counsel.
On August 1, 2021, the Company Board held a meeting attended by Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Boldt to discuss the 2024-2025 financial extrapolations
for the Company prepared by management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions underlying such extrapolations. Also in
attendance were representatives of Latham & Watkins. Mr. Boldt provided an overview of the models, projections and assumptions included in the
extrapolations. After Dr. Dunleavy and
28
Table of Contents
Mr. Boldt left the meeting and extensive discussion among the independent directors, the independent members of the Company Board approved the
extrapolations for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore. During this meeting, the members of the Special Committee and
Latham & Watkins updated the independent directors of the Board who are not on the Special Committee about the Special Committee’s activities,
Evercore’s views regarding the outreach to potential acquirers of the Company conducted by J.P. Morgan and Nordic Capital X’s ongoing due diligence
efforts and equity and debt financing activities.
On August 2, 2021, the Special Committee, with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, discussed the sale process and
the projections presented by management at the Company Board meeting on August 1, 2021. At the end of the meeting, the Special Committee invited Dr.
Dunleavy to join the meeting to provide his views to the Special Committee regarding the potential treatment of equity incentive compensation in
connection with a potential sale transaction.
On August 4, 2021, after extensive review by the Special Committee, the Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to circulate to Kirkland &
Ellis LLP an initial draft of the Merger Agreement relating to the proposed transaction which contained, among other terms favorable to the Company, a
“go shop” provision. Acting on the Special Committee’s instructions, Latham & Watkins circulated the initial draft of the Merger Agreement to Kirkland
& Ellis.
On August 5, 2021, the Special Committee, with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed the 2024-2030 financial
extrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company’s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the assumptions
underlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the Special Committee approved the ten-year extrapolations for use in valuation
analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore.
On August 6, 2021, independent members of the Company Board with representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in attendance, reviewed
the 2024-2030 financial extrapolations for the Company prepared by the Company’s management (based on the previously-approved Projections) and the
assumptions underlying such extrapolations. After extensive review and discussion, the independent members of the Company Board approved the ten-
year extrapolations for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore (such 2024-2030 financial extrapolations, as approved by the
Special Committee and the independent members of the Company Board for use in valuation analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan and Evercore, the
“Extrapolations”). During this meeting the Special Committee also provided an update on the proposal received from Nordic Capital X, Nordic Capital X’s
due diligence and financing, and the progress of negotiations of the Merger Agreement and ancillary documents. Latham & Watkins provided an
overview of the key terms of the Merger Agreement that was previously shared with Kirkland & Ellis to the independent members of the Company Board
who are not on the Special Committee.
On August 10, 2021, Kirkland & Ellis circulated to Latham & Watkins a revised draft of the Merger Agreement which removed the “go shop”
provision, proposed a Company Termination Fee representing 3.5% of the Company’s equity value and revised other key terms. Kirkland & Ellis also
circulated to Latham & Watkins initial drafts of the Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee.
On August 10, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of Evercore and Latham & Watkins in which representatives
of Evercore reviewed its preliminary financial analysis.
On the evening of August 10, 2021, representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors verbally informed J.P. Morgan that Nordic Capital X was unable
to assemble an equity financing consortium at a price of $44.00 per share and accordingly Nordic Capital X would be unable to proceed with the proposed
transaction on the economic terms previously outlined in its non-binding indication of interest. Representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors stated
that Nordic Capital X planned to send an updated indication of interest that would outline a potential transaction in which the Company’s stockholders
would receive $40.50 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity. Representatives of the Nordic
Capital Advisors also informed J.P. Morgan that Nordic Capital X expected to request that Dr. Dunleavy increase his rollover amount to $1 billion to help
provide additional equity financing necessary to fund the proposed transaction.
On August 11, 2021, the Special Committee held a meeting attended by representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss
the update provided by representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors. The Special Committee instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Evercore to reach out to a specified list of other potential buyers and strategic partners, in addition to those that had been contacted previously, to
assess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X’s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed
assess whether another party would be willing to offer a price that exceeded Nordic Capital X’s updated proposal. The Special Committee also instructed
the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore to re-solicit interest of the strategic and private equity bidders who had previously shown
29
Table of Contents
interest in exploring a transaction with the Company, including PE Firm B. The Special Committee also instructed the representatives of J.P. Morgan to
inform Nordic Capital X that a price of $40.50 was inadequate and that the Special Committee would not approve any transaction in which Dr. Dunleavy
rolled over more than the $700 million contemplated in connection with Nordic Capital X’s prior proposal, as the Special Committee viewed any
transaction that included a lower price and an increased investment by Dr. Dunleavy as problematic. The Special Committee also instructed J.P. Morgan
and Latham & Watkins to discontinue Merger Agreement negotiations with Nordic Capital X until Nordic Capital X submitted a revised indication of
interest in writing with terms the Special Committee believed it could approve, including a detailed sources and uses table outlining the debt and equity
financing for a transaction.
On August 11, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the
Company’s stockholders would receive $40.25 per share in cash, subject to further due diligence and negotiations, which cash consideration would be
financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including a combined rollover amount by Dr. Dunleavy and Cape Capital of $1.1 billion. Nordic Capital X’s
updated indication of interest reiterated that given the rollover Nordic Capital X was requiring from Dr. Dunleavy and Mr. Hoffmann, that Nordic Capital
X’s non-binding offer (and any subsequent offer) would be conditioned on the satisfaction of the Approval Conditions and that the Approval
Conditions would not be waivable. Based on prior instructions from the Special Committee, J.P. Morgan informed representatives of the Nordic Capital
Advisors that this proposal was unacceptable and that the Special Committee would not consider any further proposal from Nordic Capital X unless it
included a higher price per share and Dr. Dunleavy’s proposed rollover would not exceed the previously contemplated $700 million.
Between August 11, 2021 and August 13, 2021, J.P. Morgan, at the direction of the Company’s management, engaged in discussions with
representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors regarding revised economic terms for a potential transaction. As instructed by the Special Committee,
representatives of Evercore and J.P. Morgan also reached out to 10 potential counterparties, including PE Firm B and Company D as well as other
strategic counterparties and financial sponsors, to gauge their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company at a price at or above $41.00 per share.
On August 13, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding written indication of interest outlining a potential transaction in which the
Company’s stockholders would receive $41.00 per share in cash, which cash consideration would be financed with a mixture of debt and equity, including
a rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million and Cape Capital of $300 million.
The Special Committee held a meeting on August 13, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among
other items, an update on J.P. Morgan’s discussions with representatives of the Nordic Capital Advisors and Nordic Capital X’s revised economic terms
for the transaction. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore also provided an update on their outreach to other potential counterparties that may be
interested in an acquisition of the Company. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Evercore reported that certain potential counterparties declined to
participate further in a sale process, other potential counterparties responded with varying degrees of interest, but no potential counterparty had
expressed an interest in offering a price at or above $41.00 per share. As a result, the Special Committee authorized J.P. Morgan and Latham & Watkins to
resume discussions with Nordic Capital X and Kirkland & Ellis regarding the terms of a potential transaction on the revised economic terms proposed in
Nordic Capital X’s August 13 indication of interest.
On August 15, 2021, Nordic Capital X submitted an updated non-binding indication of interest that provided greater detail on its sources of debt
and equity financing for the transaction, including a rollover by Dr. Dunleavy of $700 million (consistent with the amount that Nordic Capital X had
previously indicated was required in order for them to proceed with the transaction and the amount that the Special Committee had previously supported)
and an increased rollover by Cape Capital to $600 million (which increase was determined by the Special Committee at a subsequent meeting to be
necessary in order to finance all required payments in connection with the transaction). Nordic Capital X’s updated indication of interest included the
Approval Conditions.
The Special Committee held a meeting on August 16, 2021 with representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins to discuss, among
other items, the status of the communications with other parties who may be interested in a transaction with the Company at price at or above $41.00 per
share, the ongoing negotiations with Nordic Capital X and the open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. Representatives of Latham & Watkins stated
that, after extensive negotiations, the remaining material open issues in the Merger Agreement included: (i) whether a “go shop” provision allowing the
Company to continue to solicit acquisition proposals following the signing of a definitive Merger Agreement would be included, (ii) the relative sizes of
the Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fees, and (iii) the date on which the parties could terminate the Merger Agreement if the closing
conditions have not been satisfied at such time (other than as a result of breach by a party). Latham & Watkins explained that Kirkland & Ellis had
informed them that Nordic Capital X
30
Table of Contents
would be unwilling to proceed with any transaction that included a “go shop” provision in the Merger Agreement. After extensive discussions, and
noting: (1) the extensive bidder outreach activity by J.P. Morgan and Evercore since May 2021 (including outreach to over 30 potential bidders, 14 of
which signed confidentiality agreements and commenced due diligence), (2) the Bloomberg article published almost three weeks earlier, (3) the fact that
the Company had not granted exclusivity to any potential bidder, (4) the fact that no other potential bidder had offered to acquire the Company at a price
at or in excess of $41.00 per share, (5) Nordic Capital X’s willingness to reduce the size of the Company Termination Fee to an amount representing to
2.75% of the Company’s equity value, (6) the high degree of deal certainty reflected in the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the size of the Parent
Termination Fee, the Equity Commitment Letter, Debt Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, and (7) the fact that Nordic Capital X was unwilling to
proceed with any transaction that included a “go shop” provision, the Special Committee determined that it would be reasonable to accept the removal of
the “go shop” provision in exchange for Nordic Capital X agreeing to a smaller Company Termination Fee, a longer Merger Agreement termination date
and other Company-favorable terms in the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee instructed Latham & Watkins to continue to negotiate the terms of
the Merger Agreement and finalize all ancillary documents.
Between August 16, 2021 and August 18, 2021, the Special Committee and Nordic Capital X through their respective legal advisors continued to
engage in ongoing negotiations of various definitive transaction documents, including the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited
Guarantee, and various ancillary agreements.
The Company Board held a meeting on the afternoon of August 17, 2021, at which time it reviewed with the Company’s management, together with
the Company’s and the Special Committee’s legal and financial advisors, a status update on negotiations of the definitive transaction. At the meeting,
Latham & Watkins reported on the resolution of certain key economic terms of the transaction and the remaining open issues in the definitive
documentation. Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed the terms of the Merger Agreement and other ancillary agreements. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan and Evercore reviewed the terms of the transaction, the sources and uses of funds in the transaction, and their respective financial analyses
of the Company. The independent members of the Company Board then met in executive session and received a briefing from the members of the Special
Committee.
On August 18, 2021, representatives of Evercore transmitted to the Special Committee an update to its written memorandum disclosing Evercore’s
material relationships with respect to several potential counterparties, including Nordic Capital X and Dr. Dunleavy.
The Company Board met again on the afternoon of August 18, 2021 with the Company’s management, together with the Company’s and the Special
Committee’s legal and financial advisors to receive an update on the status of negotiations. The independent members of the Company Board then met in
executive session and received a briefing from the members of the Special Committee.
The Special Committee met again on the evening of August 18, 2021, at which time it reviewed with representatives from Evercore and Latham &
Watkins the final outcome of negotiations. Representatives of Evercore delivered to the Special Committee its opinion, subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions set forth in its opinion, as of
August 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the Public Stockholders. After discussing the final terms of the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee ultimately unanimously recommended
that the Company Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board met again on the evening of August 18, 2021, at which time the Special Committee conveyed its recommendation that the
Company Board approve the execution by the Company of definitive transaction documents and recommend that the Company’s stockholders vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement. The Company Board then reviewed with the Company’s management, together with the Company’s legal and financial
advisors, including representatives of J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Latham & Watkins, the final outcome of negotiations. Representatives of J.P. Morgan, as
financial advisor to the Company rendered an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 19, 2021, that, based
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, as of August 18, 2021, the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders.

After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed merger described below and in the section entitled “Purpose and Reasons of the
Company for the Merger,” the independent members of Company Board (consisting of all members of the Company Board other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Nordic Capital X, the Merger and all of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; declared that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the Company enter
into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and recommended that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
At the same meeting, the members of the Audit Committee of the Company Board unanimously approved, consistent with the Company’s Audit
Committee Charter and applicable NASDAQ listing rules, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as a proposed transaction
between the Company and a related party.
On August 19, 2021, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the other parties thereto executed the Merger Agreement. On the same day, before the
opening of trading on NASDAQ, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.
Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger
As described in the section entitled “Background of the Merger,” the Company Board duly established the Special Committee and delegated to it
the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of any
potential transactions with respect to the Company and any alternatives thereto, (ii) negotiate with the counterparties to any such potential transaction or
any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms and conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives
thereto and, if the Special Committee deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of documents
pertaining to a given transaction or any alternative transaction on behalf of the Company, (iii) determine whether such proposed transaction or any
alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders (and to the extent the
Rollover Stockholders were determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other shareholders, other than
the Rollover Stockholders), (iv) recommend to the full Company Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Company Board with respect to such
proposed transaction or any alternative thereto, and (v) retain independent legal counsel and such other consultants and agents, including, without
limitation, independent investment bankers, as the Special Committee deems necessary or appropriate to perform such services and render such opinions
as may be necessary or appropriate in order for the Special Committee to discharge its duties.
The Special Committee, acting with the advice and assistance of its independent legal and financial advisors, evaluated and negotiated the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and after careful consideration, at a meeting of the Special Committee held
on August 18, 2021, the Special Committee, among other things, unanimously:
•
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Public Stockholders;
•
recommended that the Company Board approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
and declare the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company’s stockholders; and
•
recommended that, subject to approval by the Company Board, the Company Board resolve to recommend that the holders of Company
Common Stock vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
On August 18, 2021, after careful consideration, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company Board
(other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself), pursuant to resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself), among other things:
•
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Company’s stockholders;
•
adopted and approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;
32
Table of Contents
•
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock for their adoption and approval; and
•
resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
In considering the recommendations of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) with respect to the Merger, you should
be aware that executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the
Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and the Company Board were aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger and in making its decision to recommend that the Company Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. For more information about these interests, refer to the section entitled “Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the
Company in the Merger.” The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believe that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to the Public Stockholders.
The Special Committee engaged its own legal and financial advisors and received advice throughout the negotiations from such advisors. Since the
members of the Special Committee are disinterested with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, independent of, and not
affiliated with, the Parent Entities or the Rollover Stockholders, the Special Committee believed that it could effectively represent the interests of the
Public Stockholders in negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making its
decision to recommend that the Company Board adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations
and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) considered,
among other things, the following potentially positive factors, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of
importance:
•
the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Shares, including as set forth in the table under “Other Important
Information Regarding the Company — Market Price of Common Stock and Dividends,” taking into account the market performance of
the Company Class A Shares relative to the common stock of other participants in the industry in which the Company operates and general
market indices;
•
certain factors related to the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and the Company’s prospects and plans,
including:
•
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board with respect to the Company’s
business, operations, assets, financial condition, earnings, ownership structure, management, strategy, competitive position, current,
historical and projected financial performance, prospects and plans, as well as the associated risks involved achieving such
projections, prospects and plans;
•
the reviews undertaken by, and understandings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board with respect to economic and
market conditions and trends, as well as the challenges and uncertainty surrounding such conditions and trends, both on a historical
and prospective basis, in the near term and the long term, such as:
•
the nature of the industry in which the Company operates, including anticipated industry trends and rapidly changing
competitive and regulatory dynamics;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to ongoing industry consolidation and competition, including the ability of the Company
to be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the Company operates or may operate in the future without
significant further investment by the Company;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to potential increases in interest rates and the impact on debt and equity markets arising
from inflationary pressures, changes in monetary policies and other factors affecting global economic activity;
33
Table of Contents
•
the low barriers to entry in the technology industry generally, which increase the potential for challenges from new industry
competitors; and
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to anticipated structural changes in the Company’s industry due to technological
changes;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
which may have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash
flows;
•
the potential risks to the Company of continuing to have publicly traded common stock, including the risks of market volatility and
the risks relating to the Company’s dual class stock structure, including the risk that the holding of lower voting Class A Common
Stock may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to managers of
certain institutional investors;
•
certain compliance costs and obligations imposed on the Company as a result of having publicly traded common stock;
•
the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company’s concentrated stock ownership;
•
the management forecasts prepared by the Company’s management for, or otherwise made available to, the Special Committee and the
Company Board; and
•
certain challenges and limitations on the Company of continuing as a standalone public company, including the execution risk
associated with, and potential for business disruption and negative stock price reaction in connection with capital markets
transactions or a refinancing of the company’s revolving credit facility;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration consists solely of cash, providing the Company’s stockholders with certainty of value and immediate
liquidity at an attractive per Share equity value without the market or execution risks associated with continued independence;
•
the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the Merger
represents the best transaction reasonably available for Company stockholders in light of the foregoing factors as well as, among other
things:
•
the views of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement represented the
highest per Share consideration that could reasonably be obtained;
•
the conclusion of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that the per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock, was more favorable to such holders than the potential
value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including the alternative of remaining an
independent company and pursuing the Company’s current strategic plan, and other strategic or financial alternatives that might be
undertaken as an independent company, in light of a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties associated with those
alternatives, and the administrative and compliance costs associated with operating the Company as a publicly traded company;
•
that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself), with the assistance of their
respective independent legal and other advisors, had considered alternatives, including continuing to operate the Company on a
standalone basis, other potential value creating options or a sale to an alternative buyer, and considered the risks and uncertainties
associated with such alternatives, and each respectively formed the view that no other alternatives were reasonably likely to create
greater value for the Company’s stockholders than the Merger, taking into account the alternatives reasonably available to the
Company and the risk of execution, as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks (as more fully described under
“Special Factors — Background of the Merger”);
•
the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that, after a
thorough process, including extensive outreach to and negotiations with potential buyers, conducted at the direction of the Special
Committee, with the assistance of experienced independent legal and financial advisors, the Company obtained the best terms and
highest price that Parent is willing to pay for the Company and that further negotiations would have created a risk of causing Parent
to abandon the Merger altogether or materially delay the entry into definitive transaction agreements with respect to the Merger;

provided, in each case, the Acquisition Proposal is received prior to obtaining the requisite Company Stockholder Approval with
respect to the Merger Agreement Proposal;
•
that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in certain circumstances, including, among others, by the Company to accept and
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company pay Parent a Company Termination
Fee of $176,385,000 and expense reimbursement of up to $10,000,000, which amount the Special Committee and the Company Board

such termination fees in similar transactions, and the unlikelihood that a fee of such size would be a meaningful deterrent to other
acquisition proposals;

•
the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) that they were fully
informed about the extent to which the interests of the Rollover Stockholders in the Merger differ from those of the Company’s other
stockholders;
•
the fact that the Rollover Stockholders, who hold approximately 87% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, have
duly executed and entered into a Support Agreement, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their Shares in favor of the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the

affiliates, or any executive officer or director of the Company; and

the right of Company stockholders to exercise their statutory appraisal rights under the Section 262 of the DGCL and receive payment of the
fair value of their Shares in lieu of the Merger Consideration to be paid per Share, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and the DGCL, unless and until any such Company stockholder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses his, her, its or their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations
and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) considered,
among other things, a number of procedural safeguards that they believed
36
Table of Contents
were and are present to ensure the fairness of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and to permit the
Special Committee to represent effectively the interests of the Public Stockholders. These procedural safeguards include, among other things, the
following, which are not intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:
•
that the Special Committee was formed at the outset of the Company Board’s consideration of a potential transaction that included a
rollover by the Rollover Stockholders and prior to any consideration of the terms of the Merger Agreement;
•
that the Special Committee consists entirely of directors who are independent of, and not affiliated with, the Parent Entities or the Rollover
Stockholders or any of their respective affiliates, and who are not members of the Company’s management;
•
that the members of the Special Committee are disinterested with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger and had no financial interest in the Merger different from, or in addition to, the Public Stockholders generally (other
than as described in “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger”);
•
that the Special Committee had exclusive authority to decide whether or not to proceed with a transaction or any alternative thereto, subject
to the Company Board’s approval of the transactions;
•
that the Special Committee retained and was advised by its own experienced legal and financial advisors;
•
that the Special Committee had the exclusive power and authority, among other things, to (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions,
and determine the advisability of any potential transactions with respect to the Company and any alternative thereto, (ii) negotiate with the
counterparties to any such potential transaction or any other party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms and
conditions of any such potential transaction or any alternatives thereto and, (iii) determine whether such proposed transaction or any
alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and all of its stockholders (and
to the extent Dr. Dunleavy is determined to have an interest in such proposed transaction different from the interests of the other
shareholders, other than Dr. Dunleavy) and (iv) recommend to the full Company Board what action, if any, should be taken by the Company
Board with respect to such proposed transaction or any alternative thereto;
•
that the Company Board was not permitted to recommend any potential transaction or any alternative thereto for approval by the
Company’s stockholders or otherwise approve any proposed transaction or any alternative thereto without a prior favorable
recommendation of such proposed transaction or alternative thereto by the Special Committee;
•
that the Special Committee had no obligation to recommend any transaction, including a transaction with Parent, and that the Special
Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person;
•
that prior to the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Special Committee was permitted to solicit, initiate, propose or introduce the making,
submission or announcement of, or encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or offer that could constitute a potential transaction with
respect to the Company from any person;
•
that the Special Committee, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, conducted an extensive process, involving
frequent and extensive deliberations and negotiations over a period of time, to consider:
•
potential transactions and alternatives thereto, including engaging with potential counterparties; and
•
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
•
and, in each case, each member of the Special Committee was actively engaged in that process on a regular basis and was provided
with full access to the Company’s management and its advisors in connection with the evaluation process (as more fully described
under “Special Factors — Background of the Merger”);
•
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to Company Stockholder Approval, which
includes a “majority of the minority” voting requirement, pursuant to which the Merger Agreement must be approved and adopted by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding share held by the Public Stockholders, in addition to
approval and adoption by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding Shares entitled to vote, voting as a single
class;

•
that, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, were the product of extensive negotiations between the
Special Committee in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, on the one hand, and Nordic Capital X and its affiliates and advisors,
on the other hand, that resulted in the improvement, from the perspective of the Company, of other terms of the Merger and the Merger
Agreement, including the operating covenants, treatment of employee equity incentives and the amount of the termination fees, relative to
Parent’s initial proposed terms;
•
the various terms of the Merger Agreement that are intended to help ensure that the Company’s stockholders receive the highest price per
Share reasonably available, including:
•
that the Merger Agreement may be terminated, in certain circumstances, including, among others, by the Company to accept and
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement”),
provided that the Company pay Parent the Company Termination Fee;
•
that the Company Board may, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, in certain circumstances, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, including in response to (i) a Intervening Event, or (ii) a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines constitutes a Superior Proposal;
•
in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
•
that the Special Committee made its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, based upon the factors discussed in this proxy statement and with the full knowledge of the interests of the Rollover
Stockholders in the Merger.
In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions, determinations
and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) also considered,
among other things, certain countervailing factors, including the following uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors, which are not
intended to be exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:
•
that, following the completion of the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company and that the
consummation of the Merger and receipt of the Merger Consideration, while providing relative certainty of value, will not allow the
Company’s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders) to participate in potential further growth in the Company’s assets, future
earnings growth, future appreciation in value of the Company Class A Shares or any future dividends after the Merger;
•
the risk that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger may not be consummated in a timely manner or
at all, for a variety of reasons, and the consequences thereof, including (i) the potential loss of value to the Company’s stockholders,
including the reduction of the trading price of the Company Class A Shares (ii) the potential negative impact on the operations and
prospects of the Company, including the risk of loss of key personnel and certain key members of senior management, and (iii) the market’s
perception of the Company’s prospects could be adversely affected if such transactions were delayed or were not consummated;
•
the possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the potential
for suits, actions or proceedings in respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the risk of
any loss or change in the relationship of the Company and its subsidiaries with their respective employees, agents, customers and other
business relationships, and any possible effect on the Company’s ability to attract and retain key employees, including that certain key
members of senior management might choose not to remain employed with the Company prior to the completion of the Merger;
•
the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation that may arise in the future;
•
the risks and potentially negative factors described in “Special Factors — Certain Effects of the Merger” and “Special Factors — Certain
Effects on the Company if the Merger is not Completed,” respectively;
•
that the Company’s directors, officers and employees have expended and will expend extensive efforts attempting to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such persons have experienced and will experience significant distractions from
their work during the pendency of such transactions and that the Company has incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with
such transactions, even if such transactions are not consummated;
•
that the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes;
38
Table of Contents
•
the restrictions imposed by the Merger Agreement on the Company’s solicitation of acquisition proposals from third parties, and that
prospective bidders may perceive Parent’s right under the Merger Agreement to negotiate with the Company to match the terms of any
Superior Proposal prior to the Company being able to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal to be a deterrent to
making alternative proposals;
•
that the Rollover Stockholders’ existing ownership interest in the Company and obligations under the Support Agreement would likely be
taken into account by third parties considering whether to make alternative proposals;
•
the possibility that the Company may be required to pay Parent a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 and expense reimbursement of
up to $10,000,000 in cash under certain circumstances, including upon termination of the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal
(as more fully described under “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”);
•
the possibility that the Parent Termination Fee of $368,805,000 and certain enforcement expenses in cash payable by Parent to the Company,
together with other specified amounts, may be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event that the Merger Agreement is
terminated by the Company due to (a) Parent’s breach of, or failure to perform its representations, warranties or obligations under the
Merger Agreement or (b) Parent’s failure to consummate the Merger at such time at which all of the applicable conditions to Closing have
been satisfied (subject to certain conditions);
•
that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed entities with essentially no assets and the Limited Guaranty, provided by Guarantors, is
capped at $376,305,000, with respect to payment of the Parent Termination Fee and certain expense reimbursement obligations of Parent;
•
that, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in connection with the Company’s entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, the Rollover Stockholders have not agreed to vote their Shares in favor of such Superior Proposal;
•
the understanding that the Rollover Stockholders, their affiliates and various executive officers and directors have certain interests in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally (as discussed under “Special
Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger”); and
•
the restrictions placed on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, which could delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would
otherwise take with respect to the operations of the Company absent the pending completion of the Merger.
The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) concluded that, overall, the potentially positive
factors outweighed the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger. Accordingly, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
the Company’s stockholders.
In the course of evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and making the decisions,
determinations and recommendations described above, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself)
did not consider the liquidation value of the Company because (i) they considered the Company to be a viable, going concern, (ii) they believed that
liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns, (iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be
impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of the Company. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee and the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider liquidation value to be a relevant factor. Further, the Special Committee
and Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not consider the Company’s net book value, which is an accounting concept, as
a factor because they believe (i) that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of
historical costs and (ii) net book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, market conditions, trends in the industry in which the
Company operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself) believe that the trading price of the Shares at any given time represents the best available indicator of the Company’s going concern value at that
time so long as the trading price at that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. In addition, the Special
Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) implicitly considered the value of the Company as a going concern by
taking into account the value of the Company’s current and anticipated business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects

and other forwardlooking matters, as well as by considering the discounted cash flow analysis presented by J.P. Morgan to the Company Board, as more
fully described below in the section entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 42, and, in the case of
the Special Committee, the discounted cash flow analysis presented by Evercore to the Special Committee, as more fully described below in the section
entitled “Special Factors—Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46. The full text of the written opinions of J.P.
Morgan and Evercore are attached as Annex D and Annex E to this proxy statement, respectively.
Accordingly, the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement
Proposal, to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, at the Special Meeting.
The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) are not aware of any firm offer for a merger, sale of
all or a substantial part of the Company’s assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount of the Company securities having been received by the Company
from anyone other than a filing person in the two (2) years preceding the signing of the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive, but is intended to summarize the material information and factors considered by the Special Committee
and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) in their consideration of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) reached the
decision to approve the entry into the Merger Agreement and recommend its adoption by the Company’s stockholders in light of the factors described
above and other factors that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) believed were appropriate. In
view of the variety of factors and the quality and amount of information considered, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr.
Dunleavy, who recused himself) did not find it practicable to and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered
in reaching their determinations. In addition, each of the directors of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) may have given different weight to different factors. The Special Committee and the Company Board conducted an overall review of the
factors described above, including through discussions with the Company’s management and their respective legal and financial advisors, and
considered the factors overall to be favorable to, and to support, their decisions, determinations and recommendations. It should be noted that this
explanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and certain information
presented in this section is forward looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward Looking Information.”
Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information
Except for annual and quarterly guidance, the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future
performance, earnings or other results due to the inherent uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions, estimates and
projections. In connection with its consideration of the Company’s stand-alone prospects and potential strategic transactions available to the Company,
management of the Company prepared and provided to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P. Morgan the Projections and
Extrapolations. The Special Committee subsequently directed Evercore, and the Company Board subsequently directed J.P. Morgan, to use the
Projections and Extrapolations in connection with rendering their fairness opinions to the Special Committee and to the Company, respectively and
performing their related financial analysis, as described above under the headings “— Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor” and “—
Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor.” The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations is included in this proxy statement solely to give the
Company’s stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to the Special Committee, the Company Board, Evercore and J.P.
Morgan. The summary of the Projections and Extrapolations may not be appropriate for other purposes and is not being included in this proxy statement
to influence a Company stockholder’s decision whether to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger.
The Projections and Extrapolations were prepared by our management for internal use. The Projections and Extrapolations were not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP (as detailed below), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding
projections, the use of non-GAAP financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with
respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Company’s management, were prepared on a reasonable basis, reflected the best
available estimates and judgments at the time of preparation and presented as of the time of preparation, to the best of the Company’s management’s
knowledge and belief, the reasonable projections of the future financial performance of the Company.
40
Table of Contents
Neither the Company’s independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. The reports of
the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relate to the Company’s historical
financial information. None of those reports extend to any of the Projections or Extrapolations described below and should not be read to do so.
The Projections and Extrapolations, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions
that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company’s management. Because the Projections and Extrapolations cover
multiple years, by their nature, they also become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to
the Company’s business and the industry in which it participates may affect actual results and result in the Projections and Extrapolations not being
achieved. For a description of some of these factors, the Company’s stockholders are urged to review the Company’s most recent SEC filings as well as
the discussion entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements” and other risk factors described in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. In
addition, the Projections and Extrapolations may be affected by the Company’s inability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the
applicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the future performance of the Company or that
actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial information.
The inclusion of the Projections and Extrapolations in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives considered or considers the Projections and Extrapolations to be necessarily predictive of actual
future events, and the Projections and Extrapolations should not be relied upon as such. Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates,
advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any of the Company’s stockholders or any other person
regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the Projections and Extrapolations or can give any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections and Extrapolations, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections and Extrapolations to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Projections and Extrapolations were
generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Projections and Extrapolations
are shown to be in error. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the Projections and Extrapolations,
except as otherwise required by law.
The Projections and Extrapolations include non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow, which
were presented because management believed they could be useful indicators of the Company’s projected future operating performance. The Company
prepared the Projections and Extrapolations on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be
comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. As used herein, “GAAP” means generally accepted accounting principles.
All financial projections are forward looking statements. These and other forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2020, and subsequent quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Please consider carefully the discussion entitled
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Information” elsewhere in the proxy statement.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and Extrapolations, the Company’s stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Projections and Extrapolations.

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor
Pursuant to an engagement letter, the Company retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger.
At the meeting of the Company Board on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in
preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its August 18, 2021 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board, dated August 19, 2021,
that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated August 19, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing its opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s public common stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s
opinion was addressed to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger,
was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as
to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by Company to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion
was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how
such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.
In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
•
reviewed the Merger Agreement;
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates;
•
compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies J.P.
Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies;
•
compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P.
Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded
securities of such other companies;
•
reviewed the Projections and Extrapolations; and
•
performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of
its opinion.
In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and Parent with respect to certain aspects of
the Merger, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the
Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its
42
Table of Contents
engagement letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not
conduct or was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or
Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P.
Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses
or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also
assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions
with, and materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Merger Agreement and
pursuant to the certificate of incorporation. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and Parent in the
Merger Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal,
regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all
material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse
effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.
The Projections and Extrapolations furnished to J.P. Morgan were prepared by the Company’s management, as discussed more fully under “Certain
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.” The Company does not publicly disclose internal management Projections and Extrapolations of the
type provided to J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such Projections and Extrapolations were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These Projections and Extrapolations were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company’s management, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and
competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such Projections and
Extrapolations. For more information regarding the use of Projections and Extrapolations and other forward-looking statements, please refer to the section
entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information.”
J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.
Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P.
Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion
as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the proposed Merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no
opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any
class of such persons relative to the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders in the proposed Merger or with respect to
the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company’s common stock will trade at any future
time.
The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders, were determined
through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the
Company Parent. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of
the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the proposed
Merger or the consideration, including the consideration to be paid to the Company’s public common stockholders.
In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodologies in rendering its
opinion to the Company Board on August 18, 2021 and in the financial analysis presented to the Company Board on such date in connection with the
rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its opinion
to the Company Board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand the
financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.

Table of Contents
Public Trading Multiples. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of the Company with similar data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to those engaged by the Company.
The companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
•
NICE LTD.
•
PTC Inc.
•
Black Knight, Inc.
•
GoDaddy Inc.
•
Datto Holding Corp.
•
Qualys, Inc.
•
Mimecast Limited
•
Omnicell, Inc.
•
R1 RCM Inc.
•
Health Equity, Inc.
These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, were considered in its judgment sufficiently similar in certain respects to those of the Company based on business
sector participation, operational characteristics and financial metrics. However, none of the selected companies reviewed is identical or directly
comparable to the Company and certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the Company. The
analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the companies differently than they would affect the Company.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of firm value to the Wall Street research analyst
consensus estimate of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Based on the results of this analysis and
other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple reference range of 18.5x – 24.0x. After applying such range to the
projected Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022, the analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value
(rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the common stock of the Company of $34.00 to $45.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the
Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the
implied per share consideration of $41.00.
Selected Transaction Multiple Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions involving businesses
which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the Company’s business (or aspects thereof) based on J.P. Morgan’s experience and familiarity
with the industries in which the Company operates (the “J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions”). The following transactions were selected by J.P. Morgan as
relevant to the evaluation of the proposed Merger:

None of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed Merger. Certain of these transactions may have
characteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed Merger. However, the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions were chosen because
certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed Merger. The analyses necessarily
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other
factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed Merger.
Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each J.P. Morgan Selected Transaction, the multiple of the target company’s firm
value implied in the relevant transaction to the target company’s revenue for the next twelve-month period following announcement (the “NTM”) of the
applicable transaction (the “FV/NTM Revenue Multiple”).
Based on the above analysis, J.P. Morgan selected a FV/NTM Revenue Multiple reference range for the Company of 7.0x to 11.0x. J.P. Morgan then
applied such reference range to the Company’s projected revenue for the NTM as of August 3, 2021. The analysis indicated a range of implied equity
values per share (rounded to the nearest $0.25) of $32.75 to $54.50, which J.P. Morgan compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company
common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per
share consideration of $41.00.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted
equity value per share for the Company common stock. J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that the Company is expected to generate
during fiscal years 2021E through 2030E based upon the financial Projections and Extrapolations prepared by Company management (as set forth in the
section entitled “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”, which was discussed with, and approved by, the Company Board for use by
J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial analyses). J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of this period by
applying perpetual growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%, based on guidance provided by the Company’s management and on J.P. Morgan’s
professional judgment and experience, to estimates of the unlevered terminal free cash flows for the Company at the end of fiscal-year 2030E, as provided
in the Company management Projections and Extrapolations. J.P. Morgan then discounted the unlevered free cash flow estimates and the range of
terminal values to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00% for the Company, which range was chosen by J.P.
Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Company. The present value of the unlevered free cash flow estimates and
the range of terminal values were then adjusted by subtracting net debt and other adjustments for the Company as of August 3, 2021.
Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied per share equity value (rounded to the nearest $0.25) for the Company common
stock of $34.00 to $51.75, which was compared to (i) the unaffected closing price of the Company common stock of $32.71 as of July 26, 2021, (ii) the
closing price of the Company common stock of $37.22 as of August 18, 2021 and (iii) the implied per share consideration of $41.00.
Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the
analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value
of the Company. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving
at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether
any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered
the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the J.P. Morgan Selected Transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger.
However, the companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and
45
Table of Contents
businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of the Company. The transactions selected were similarly
chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved
and other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.
As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company
with respect to the Merger and deliver an opinion to the Company Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience
and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.
For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger, the Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan an estimated fee of $42 million,
$3.0 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable
upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with its services, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out
of J.P. Morgan’s engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, neither J.P. Morgan nor its affiliates have had any other
material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, Parent, Meritas Group, Inc., which holds
approximately 30% of the capital stock of the Company, GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture Partners, L.P. or 22C Capital LLC. During the two years preceding
the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had and continue to have commercial or investment banking relationships with
certain affiliates of Parent, including Parent’s parent company, Nordic Capital X, as well as certain affiliates of each of GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture
Partners, L.P. and 22C Capital LLC, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. In addition, J.P.
Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of GIC Pte. Ltd. and certain
affiliates of Insight Venture Partners, L.P., for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. During the two year period preceding delivery of
its opinion ending on August 18, 2021, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from Nordic Capital X were approximately $15.2 million. During the
two year period preceding delivery of its opinion ending on August 18, 2021, J.P. Morgan did not recognize any fees from the Company or Parent. In the
ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any
time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
Opinion of the Special Committee’s Financial Advisor
The Special Committee retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger. As part of this engagement, the Special
Committee requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Public
Stockholders. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on August 18, 2021, Evercore rendered to the Special Committee its opinion to the effect that, as
of August 18, 2021 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Evercore’s opinion, the
Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share to be received by the Public Stockholders in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Public
Stockholders.
The full text of the written opinion of Evercore, dated August 18, 2021, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as
Annex E to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The Special Committee encourages you to read this opinion carefully and in
its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other
persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger.
Evercore’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.

by the Special Committee;
(iii)

Set forth below is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with the Special Committee on August 18, 2021 in connection
with rendering its opinion. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The
order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore.
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or
before August 13, 2021, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered general business, economic, market and financial conditions, industry sector
performance, and other matters, as they existed and could be evaluated as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of the
Company. The estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are
not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and
the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The following summary of Evercore’s financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
analyses, the tables should be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a
complete description of Evercore’s financial analyses. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of Evercore’s
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such
analyses.
Summary of Evercore’s Financial Analyses
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, free
cash flows, defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, taxes, capital expenditures, and changes in net working capital. Net
working capital is defined as the difference between current assets and current liabilities, that the Company was forecasted to generate during the
Company’s fiscal years 2021 through 2030 based on the Projections and Extrapolations. Evercore calculated terminal values for the Company by applying
perpetuity growth rates of 3.00% to 4.00%, which range was selected based on Evercore’s professional judgment and experience, to a terminal year
estimate of the unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate based on the Projections and Extrapolations. The cash
flows and terminal values in each case were then discounted to present value as of August 3, 2021 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% to 9.00%,
which were based on an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital. Based on this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s
estimated net debt

(calculated as total debt (including capitalized leases) less cash and cash equivalents) as of August 3, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of
Company common stock, in each case as provided by or based on information provided by the Company’s management, this analysis indicated a range
of implied equity values per share of Company common stock of $33.83 to $51.31, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company
common stock.

Based on the multiples it derived for the selected companies and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied (i) an
enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 22.0x – 28.0x to the Company’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar year 2021, (ii) an
enterprise value/Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range of 19.0x – 25.0x to the Company’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA in calendar year 2022, (iii) an
enterprise value/Revenue multiple reference range of 7.0x – 10.0x to the Company’s estimated Revenue in calendar year 2021 and (iv) an enterprise
value/Revenue multiple reference range of 6.0x – 9.0x to the Company’s estimated Revenue in calendar year 2022, in each case, based on the Projections
and Extrapolations. Based on these ranges of implied enterprise values, the Company’s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt (including capitalized
leases) less cash and cash equivalents) as of August 13, 2021 (except as otherwise noted), and the number of fully diluted shares of Company common
stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s management, this analysis indicated ranges of implied equity values per share of Company common
stock as set forth below in more detail, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common Stock.

Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, Evercore selected these companies because they are publicly
traded Healthcare Technology and Technology / Software companies that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally
relevant to the Company for purposes of its financial analyses. In evaluating the selected companies, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with
regard to general business, economic and market conditions affecting the selected companies and other matters, as well as differences in the selected
companies’ financial, business and operating characteristics. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect the relative values of the selected
companies and the multiples derived from the selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a
meaningful method of using the data of the selected companies.

For each selected transaction, Evercore calculated the implied enterprise value (defined as the target company’s implied equity value based on the
consideration paid in the applicable transaction plus total debt (including capitalized leases), less cash and cash equivalents) as (i) a multiple of last
twelve-month Revenue for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we refer to as “LTM Revenue” and
(ii) a multiple of next twelve-month estimated Revenue for the target company at the time of the announcement of the applicable transaction, which we
refer to as “NTM Revenue”. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant transaction.

Based on the multiples it derived from the selected transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore selected a
reference range of enterprise value to LTM Revenue multiples of 7.0x to 11.0x and a reference range of enterprise value to NTM Revenue multiples of 6.0x
to 10.0x and applied these ranges of multiples to the Company’s LTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 based on the financial results for the Company
provided by the Company’s management and to the Company’s NTM Revenue as of June 30, 2021 based on the Projections and Extrapolations. Based on
this range of implied enterprise values, the Company’s estimated net debt (calculated as total debt (including capitalized leases) less cash and cash
equivalents) as of August 13, 2021, and the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock, in each case as provided by the Company’s
management, this analysis indicated ranges of implied equity values per share of Company common stock as set forth below in more detail, compared to

Although none of the target companies or businesses reviewed in the selected transactions analysis is directly comparable to the Company and
none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, Evercore selected these transactions because they involve companies or
businesses that Evercore, in its professional judgment and experience, considered generally relevant to the Company for purposes of its financial
analyses. In evaluating the selected transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic and market
conditions and other factors existing at the time of the selected transactions, and other matters, as well as differences in financial, business and operating
characteristics and other factors relevant to the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of
this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments regarding many factors that could affect
the relative values of the target companies or businesses in the selected transactions and the multiples derived from the selected transactions.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data of the selected transactions.
Other Factors
Evercore also noted certain other factors, which were not considered material to its financial analyses with respect to its opinion, but were
referenced for informational purposes only, including, among other things, the following:
Last 52-Week Trading Range
Evercore reviewed historical trading prices of shares of Company common stock during the twelve month period ended July 26, 2021, the last
trading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X, noting that the low and high closing prices during such
period ranged from $17.56 to $34.47 per share of Company Common Stock, respectively.
Equity Research Analyst Price Targets
Evercore reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the shares of Company Common Stock prepared and published by equity
research analysts that were publicly available as of August 13, 2021. These price targets reflect analysts’ estimates of the future public market trading
price of the shares of Company common stock at the time the price target was published. As of August 13, 2021, the range of selected equity research
analyst price targets per share of Company Common Stock was $23.00 to $45.00. Public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts
do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the shares of Company Common Stock and these target prices and the analysts’ earnings
estimates on which they were based are subject to risk and uncertainties, including factors affecting the financial performance of the Company and future
general industry and market conditions.
Premiums Paid Analysis
Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 21 selected transactions and announced bids for control of US public targets with an
aggregate transaction value between $1 billion and $15 billion in the healthcare and technology industries since January 1, 2019. Using publicly available
information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid or proposed to be paid in each such
transaction exceeded the unaffected market prices per share of the target companies prior to announcement of each transaction.
51
Table of Contents
Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a premium range of 20% to 35% (based on the
25th and 75th percentile of the premiums paid in the selected transactions) to the closing price per share of Company Common Stock of $32.71 as of July
26, 2021, the last trading day prior to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X. This analysis indicated a range of implied
equity values per share of Company Common Stock of $39.25 to $44.16, compared to the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common
Stock.
Preliminary Presentations
In addition to the presentation and financial analyses, dated August 17, 2021, made to the Special Committee described above in connection with
its opinion, dated August 18, 2021, a copy of such presentation has been attached as Exhibit (c)(ix) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed
with the SEC in connection with the Merger, Evercore also delivered preliminary written and oral presentation materials to the Special Committee on
August 10, 2021 and August 16, 2021 (collectively, the “Preliminary Presentation Materials”). A copy of the Preliminary Presentation Materials has been
attached as Exhibits (c)(vii) and (c)(viii) to the Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger. Information
contained in the Preliminary Presentation Materials was substantially similar to the information provided in Evercore’s presentation and financial analyses
made to the Special Committee described above in connection with its written opinion. The financial analyses in the Preliminary Presentation Materials
were based on market, economic and other conditions as they existed as of the date of such presentation(s) as well as other information that was
available at such time. Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses differed due to changes in those conditions. Finally, Evercore continued to refine
various aspects of its financial analyses with respect to the Company over time.
The Preliminary Presentation Materials were for discussion purposes only and did not present any findings or make any recommendations or
constitute an opinion of Evercore with respect to the fairness of the Merger Consideration or otherwise. The financial analyses performed by Evercore in
relation to its opinion dated August 18, 2021 superseded all analyses and information presented in the Preliminary Presentation Materials.
Miscellaneous
The foregoing summary of Evercore’s financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by
Evercore to the Special Committee. In connection with the review of the Merger by the Special Committee, Evercore performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible
to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the
results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its
opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its professional judgment and experience after considering the results of all
the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
combination of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with respect to the actual value of the shares of Company
common stock. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.
Evercore prepared these analyses for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Special Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Merger Consideration to the Public Stockholders. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the
business or securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s
analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecasted in such estimates.
Evercore’s financial advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and benefit of the Special Committee (in its capacity as
such) in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The issuance of Evercore’s opinion was approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore.
Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Special Committee or the Company’s management or that any specific
amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the Merger for the holders of Company Common Stock.

Table of Contents
Pursuant to the terms of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee, the Company has agreed to pay Evercore a retainer fee for its
services equal to $3 million which was payable upon execution of Evercore’s engagement letter with the Special Committee. The Company also agreed to
pay Evercore an opinion fee equal to $1 million upon delivery of Evercore’s opinion which is fully creditable against the $3 million retainer fee. The
Evercore engagement letter also provides for, at the conclusion of the assignment thereunder, an additional discretionary fee in an amount not to exceed
$7 million, based upon, among other things, the resources expended by Evercore in the course of the assignment, the Special Committee’s satisfaction
with the services rendered and the benefit to the Special Committee of the successful conclusion of the assignment, to be determined by the Special
Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition, the Evercore engagement letter provides for additional fees to be paid to Evercore if the Special
Committee and Evercore agree to expand the scope of Evercore’s services, which fees shall be mutually agreed between the parties. The Company has
also agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses and to indemnify Evercore against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.
During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company and Evercore has not received any compensation from the Company during such period. During the period January 1, 2019 to
August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to Nordic Capital X and/or certain of its affiliates and received fees
for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $9 million. During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its
affiliates have provided financial advisory services to GIC and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount
of approximately $46 million. During the period January 1, 2019 to August 18, 2021, Evercore and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to
Insight and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the rendering of these services in the amount of approximately $57 million. Evercore may provide
financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror and their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC, Insight and their
respective affiliates, in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.
Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for its and their own accounts and the accounts of customers, including corporate
finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related activities. In
connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or its or their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which
any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect
transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or other financial
instruments of or relating to the Company, Parent and/or any of their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC, Insight and their respective
affiliates, or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates, including Nordic Capital X, GIC,
Insight and their respective affiliates.
The Special Committee engaged Evercore to act as a financial advisor based on Evercore’s qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly provides fairness opinions to its clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
Position of Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger
Under a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, Nordic Capital X, Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL, Parent
and Merger Sub (together, the (“Parent Entities”)) may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their beliefs as to the
fairness of the proposed Merger to the Public Stockholders. Parent and Merger Sub are making the statements included in this section solely for
purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. However, the view of Parent and
Merger Sub as to the fairness of the Merger should not be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder as to how that stockholder
should vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have interests in the Merger that are different from, and in addition
to, those of the other stockholders of the Company.
Parent and Merger Sub did not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who
recused himself) regarding, nor receive advice from the respective legal or other advisors of the Special Committee or the Company Board (other than Dr.
Dunleavy, who recused himself) as to, the fairness of the Merger. The Parent Entities have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any
valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholder. Based on, among other things, the factors
considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Company Board (other than Mr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and the Special
Committee discussed in “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the
Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” (which analysis and resulting
53
Table of Contents
conclusions Parent and Merger Sub adopt), Parent and Merger Sub believe that the Merger is substantively fair to the Public Stockholders. In particular,
the Parent Entities considered the following:
•
the fact that the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) unanimously determined that
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and the Company’s stockholders;
•
the fact that no member of the Company’s senior management other than Dr. Dunleavy has a substantial financial interest in the Merger that
is different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Public Stockholders generally, although the Merger Agreement does include
customary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the Company’s officers and directors;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration is all cash, thus allowing the Company’s stockholders to immediately realize a certain and fair value
for their Shares, which value represents a significant premium over the closing price of the Shares on July 26, 2021, the last trading day prior
to the public report of a rumored sale of the Company to Nordic Capital X;
•
the fact that the Merger will provide liquidity for the Public Stockholders without the delays that would otherwise be necessary in order to
liquidate the positions of larger holders, and without incurring brokerage and other costs typically associated with market sales; and
•
the fact that the Merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by Parent, increasing the likelihood that the Merger will be
consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the Merger will be received.
The Parent Entities further believe that the Merger is procedurally fair to the Public Stockholders based upon, among other things, the following
factors:
•
the fact that the Special Committee retained, and had the benefit of advice from, nationally recognized legal and financial advisors;
•
that the Special Committee had the authority to reject any proposals made by Parent or any other person;
•
the fact that the Merger Consideration was the result of the Special Committee’s extensive arm’s-length negotiations with Parent;
•
the fact that the closing of the Merger is conditioned on the Company’s receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to provide information to, or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding Acquisition Proposals that constitute Superior Proposals;
•
the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances as set out in the Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement related to a Superior Proposal, subject to paying Parent a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 in cash, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement; and
•
the availability of appraisal rights to the Company’s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders) who comply with all of the required
procedures under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights, which allow such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Shares.
The Parent Entities also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the substantive and procedural fairness of the
proposed Merger, including:
•
that the stockholders of the Company (other than the Rollover Stockholders) will not participate in any future earnings, appreciation in
value or growth of the Company’s business and will not benefit from any potential sale of the Company or its assets to a third party in the
future;
•
the risk that the Merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all;
•
that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with essentially no assets other than the equity and funding commitments of the
Equity Investors and Debt Commitment Parties;
•
the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement, which
may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise and certain other actions it might otherwise take
with respect to the operations of the Company pending completion of the Merger;
54
Table of Contents
•
the negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could potentially have on the Company’s business
and relationships with its employees, vendors and customers;
•
that the Company and its subsidiaries are restricted from soliciting, initiating, or encouraging the submission of Acquisition Proposals from
Third Parties or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
•
the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by the Company upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including payment to
Parent of a Company Termination Fee of $176,385,000 in cash, and the processes required to terminate the Merger Agreement, including the
opportunity for Parent to make revisions to its Merger proposal, could discourage other potential acquirors from making a competing bid to
acquire the Company;
•
the potential negative effect that the pendency of the Merger, or a failure to complete the Merger, could have on the Company’s business
and relationships with its employees, vendors and customers; and
•
the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to the Company’s stockholders (other than the Rollover Stockholders with respect to
the Rollover Shares) that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Parent Entities in connection with the fairness of the
Merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by them. The Parent Entities did not find it practicable to,
and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their conclusion as to the fairness of the Merger. Rather, the
Parent Entities reached their position as to the fairness of the Merger after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The Parent Entities believe these
factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their position regarding the fairness of the Merger to the Public Stockholders. This position
should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder to approve the Merger Agreement. The Parent Entities make no
recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger. The Parent Entities attempted to negotiate the
terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to them, and not to the stockholders of the Company, and, accordingly, did not negotiate the Merger
Agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such stockholders. None of the Parent Entities believes that it has or had any fiduciary duty to
the Company or its stockholders, including with respect to the Merger and its terms.
Based on the Parent Entities’ knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, the Special Committee and the Company
Board, as well as discussions with members of the Company’s senior management regarding the Company and its business and the factors considered
by, and findings of, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) and discussed in this proxy statement
in the section entitled “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the
Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger,” the Parent Entities believe that the Merger is fair to the Public Stockholders.
Purpose and Reasons of the Parent Entities for the Merger
Under a possible interpretation of the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, each of the Parent Entities may be deemed to be affiliates
of the Company and, therefore, required to express their reasons for the Merger to the Company’s Unaffiliated Stockholders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 of
the Exchange Act. The Parent Entities are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of
Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. For the Parent Entities, the primary purpose of the Merger is to allow Parent to own equity interests
in the Company and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed and the Shares cease to be publicly traded. The Parent
Entities believe that structuring the transaction in such manner is preferable to other transaction structures because it (i) will enable Parent to acquire all
of the Shares at the same time, (ii) will allow the Company to cease to be a publicly registered and reporting company, and (iii) represents an opportunity
for the Public Stockholders (other than the holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares and the Rollover Stockholders with respect to the Rollover
Shares) to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Position of the Rollover Stockholders as to the Fairness of the Merger
Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders and certain of their affiliates, including Dr. Dunleavy,
through certain Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company and, therefore, required to express their beliefs as to
the fairness of the proposed Merger to the Public Stockholders. The Merger is the Rule 13e-3 transaction for which a Schedule 13E-3 Transaction
Statement has been filed with the SEC. As described below, the Rollover Stockholders believe that the Merger is fair to the Public Stockholders on the
basis of the
55
Table of Contents
factors described under “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the
Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger” and “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger.” Dr. Dunleavy did
not participate in the deliberations of the Special Committee or the Company Board regarding the Merger, and did not receive advice from the legal or
other advisors of the Company or the Special Committee as to the fairness of the Merger. As disclosed under “Special Factors — Interests of Executive
Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger,” the Rollover Stockholders have interests in the Merger both the same as those of the Public
Stockholders by virtue of the expected receipt of the per Share Merger Consideration for a portion of the Rollover Stockholders’ equity interests in the
Company upon completion of the Merger, and not identical to those of the Public Stockholders by virtue of the Rollover Stockholders’ ability to roll over
a portion of their ownership stake in the Company (such rollover being valued with the same per Share valuation of the Shares used to determine the
Merger Consideration) in exchange for a continuing ownership stake in Parent.
The Public Stockholders were represented by the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement on their
behalf, with the assistance of the Special Committee’s independent legal and financial advisors. The Merger was approved by the directors of the
Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself). Based on the knowledge and analysis of the Rollover Stockholders of available
information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with the Company’s management regarding the Company and its business and the factors
considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused
himself), the Rollover Stockholders believe that the Merger is substantively and procedurally fair to the Public Stockholders based upon substantially the
same factors considered by the Parent Entities with respect to the substantive and procedural fairness of the proposed Merger to such Public
Stockholders. See “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger” The Rollover Stockholders agree with the
analyses, determinations and conclusions described under “Special Factors — Position of the Parent Entities as to the Fairness of the Merger,” and
“Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board and the Special Committee;
Fairness of the Merger.”
While Dr. Dunleavy is an officer and director of the Company, because of the interests described under the section captioned “Special Factors —
Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger,” he did not serve on the Special Committee or participate in the Special
Committee’s evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and he recused himself from and did
not participate in, or vote in connection with, the Company Board’s evaluation or approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. For these reasons, the Rollover Stockholders do not believe that their interests in the Merger influenced the decisions or
recommendations of the Special Committee or the Company Board with respect to the Merger Agreement or the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Rollover Stockholders in connection with the fairness
of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all
material factors considered by the Rollover Stockholders. The Rollover Stockholders did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their position as to the fairness of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. Rather, the Rollover Stockholders made the fairness determinations after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The
Rollover Stockholders believe these factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form the belief that the Merger is fair to the Public Stockholders.
This belief should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any Company stockholder to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Rollover
Stockholders do not make any recommendation as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.
Purpose and Reasons of the Rollover Stockholders for the Merger
Under the SEC rules governing “going private” transactions, the Rollover Stockholders and certain of their affiliates, including Dr. Dunleavy,
through the Dunleavy Entities, and Cape Capital may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company, and, therefore, required to express their purposes and
reasons for the Merger to the Public Stockholders. The Rollover Stockholders and their affiliates are making the statements in this section solely for the
purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. The Rollover Stockholders do not make any
recommendations as to how stockholders of the Company should vote their Shares relating to the Merger.
Dr. Dunleavy has served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer since his organization of the company’s predecessor companies in 1998, as
Chairman of the Company Board since the creation of the board in 2006, and as President from the Company’s foundation until May of 2014. The Rollover
Stockholders considered favorable current market conditions, and
56
Table of Contents
concluded that a take-private transaction that would provide fair value to all of the Company’s stockholders, including the Public Stockholders, could be
attractive. Dr. Dunleavy indicated to the Company Board prior to the establishment of the Special Committee that he would only support a transaction as
a stockholder in which he received the same consideration as the Public Stockholders in respect of all Company Common Stock held by him. However,
following the establishment of the Special Committee, representatives of Nordic Capital Advisors indicated they were not prepared to move forward with
a proposed transaction without a significant rollover of existing Company Common Stock. As a result, the Rollover Stockholders eventually agreed to
enter into the Rollover Agreements because they believed that the overall benefits of the Merger outweighed the detriments to them associated with the
Rollover Agreements, including the lack of liquidity the Rollover Stockholders will have in the equity of Parent, the control of Parent by affiliates of
Nordic Capital X, and the increased risk associated with the leverage contemplated for the Company after closing. In determining to enter into the
Rollover Agreements, the Rollover Stockholders also considered the confidence they have in the existing management team and in the prospects of the
Company and in the track record of Nordic Capital Advisors to operate acquired companies.
The Rollover Stockholders believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders to effect a liquidity transaction while market
conditions remain favorable, as well as in the best interests of the Company to operate as a privately held entity. The Rollover Stockholders believe that,
as a privately held entity, the Company will have greater operational flexibility to pursue alternatives than it would have as a public company, and
management of the Company will be able to concentrate on long-term growth, reducing the focus on the quarter-to-quarter performance often emphasized
by the public equity market’s valuation of the Shares. Although the Rollover Stockholders believe that there may be substantial opportunities associated
with their contribution to Ocala Topco, LP of the Rollover Shares, the Rollover Stockholders recognize that there may also be substantial risks (including
the risks and uncertainties relating to the prospects of the Company) and that such opportunities may not ever be fully realized.
If the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Shares will cease to be publicly traded. For the
Rollover Stockholders, the purpose of the Merger is to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the separate Rollover
Agreements, which will allow the Rollover Stockholders to realize the value of a portion of their Shares by receiving $41.00 per Share in cash for a portion
of their investment in the Company and own equity interests of Parent and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the Merger is completed
and the Shares cease to be publicly traded. The Rollover Stockholders believe that structuring the transaction in such a manner is preferable to other
alternative transaction structures because (i) it will enable Parent to acquire all of the outstanding Shares of the Company at the same time; (ii) it
represents an opportunity for the Public Stockholders to immediately realize the value of their investment in the Company and for the Rollover
Stockholders to immediately realize the value of a significant portion of their investment in the Company at a price of $41.00 per Share in cash, without
interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) it
allows the Rollover Stockholders to continue to own indirect equity interests in the Company after the Merger and to bear the rewards and risks of such
ownership after the Merger.
Plans for the Company After the Merger
Following completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will have been merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Shares of the Company are currently listed on the Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act. Following
completion of the Merger, there will be no further market for the Shares and, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in compliance
with Applicable Law, the Company’s securities will be delisted from the Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.
The Parent Entities currently anticipate that the Company’s operations initially will be conducted following completion of the Merger substantially
as they are currently being conducted (except that the Company will cease to be a public company and will instead be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent). The Parent Entities are currently conducting a review of the Company and its business and operations with a view towards determining how to
redirect the Company’s operations to improve the Company’s long-term earnings potential as a private company (including by reducing the Company’s
costs and expenses following the Merger) and expect to complete such review following completion of the Merger. Further, following completion of the
Merger, the Parent Entities will continue to assess the Company’s assets, corporate and capital structure, capitalization, operations, business, properties
and personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable following the Merger to enhance the business and operations of the
Company. In addition, Parent may seek to buy or combine the Company with target companies that provide earnings and growth synergies; however, no
definitive contracts, arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understanding currently exist. Although presently there are no definitive contracts,
arrangements, plans, proposals, commitments or understandings regarding any such transactions, the Parent Entities and certain of their affiliates may
seek, from and after the Effective Time, to acquire target companies or assets that operate in the Company’s industry.
57
Table of Contents
From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation and, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.
Certain Effects of the Merger
If the Required Company Stockholder Approval is obtained and all other conditions to the Closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the following will
occur.
Treatment of the Shares
At the Effective Time, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon the holders of such Shares will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement.
Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards
Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and as a result of the Merger:
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Option in writing, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price,
and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option. If the exercise price per share of any
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Option will automatically terminate and be
cancelled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company RSU Award in writing, each Company RSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a
cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award.
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Cash-Out Company RS Award in writing, each Cash-Out Company
RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be
achieved at the “target” level of performance).
•
Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Conversion Company RS Award in writing, each Conversion
Company RS Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into a cash-based retention award in
an amount, without interest equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the RS Award which cash-based retention award will remain subject to the same vesting schedule that applied immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any applicable vesting criteria and requirements).
All amounts will be paid less any applicable withholding taxes, and paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case
later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time of the
Merger).
Following the date of the Merger Agreement, no new offering period will commence under the ESPP, each participant’s outstanding right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if
not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ESPP) and the ESPP will be terminated no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.
58
Table of Contents
Benefits of the Merger for the Company’s Public Stockholders
The primary benefit of the Merger to the Public Stockholders (other than the holders of any Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will be their
right to receive the Merger Consideration of $41.00 per Share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, representing a premium of 25.3% over the closing price of Company Class A
Common Stock on July 26, 2021, the last unaffected trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction, and a premium of 24.4% over
the volume-weighted average price of the Shares over the thirty (30) trading days leading up to the unaffected trading day. Additionally, such Public
Stockholders will avoid the risk after the Merger of any possible decrease in the Company’s future earnings, growth or value.
Detriments of the Merger to the Company’s Public Stockholders
The primary detriments of the Merger to the Public Stockholders include the lack of an interest of such Public Stockholders in the potential future
earnings, growth, or value realized by the Company after the Merger. In addition, the Public Stockholders will not benefit from any sale of the Company or
its assets to a third party in the future.
Certain Effects of the Merger for the Parent Entities
Following the Merger, all the equity interests in the Company will be beneficially owned, indirectly through Parent, by the Rollover Stockholders,
the Equity Investors and additional members of a consortium of private equity investors led by Nordic Capital X and their affiliates. If the Merger is
completed, the Parent Entities, the Rollover Stockholders, the Equity Investors and additional members of the consortium of private equity investors led
by Nordic Capital X and their affiliates will be the sole beneficiaries of the Company’s future earnings and growth, if any, and they will be the only ones
entitled to vote on corporate matters affecting the Company following the Merger.
Certain Effects on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement Proposal is not approved by the Company’s stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s stockholders will not receive any payment for their Shares in connection with the Merger. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third
party, the Company will remain an independent public company, and the Shares will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq, so long as the
Company continues to meet the applicable listing requirements. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company expects that management will
operate the Company’s business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today, and that the Company’s stockholders will continue to be
subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject. There is no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your Shares, including the risk that the market price of Shares may decline to the extent the current market price of Shares reflects a
market assumption that the Merger will be completed.
Under certain circumstances, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee, as well as
pay certain enforcement costs and, under certain circumstances, reimburse up to $10,000,000 of Parent’s out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee, as well as pay
certain enforcement costs. See “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”
Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger
In considering the recommendations of the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) with respect to the Merger, the
Company’s stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of the Company have certain interests in the Merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally. The Special Committee, consisting solely of independent and
disinterested directors of the Company Board, and the Company Board were aware of these interests and considered the interests described below,
among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and in making their
recommendations.
Special Committee Fees
Consistent with past practice of the Company Board and its committees, the members of the Special Committee, consisting solely of independent
directors who (i) are not affiliated with Dr. Dunleavy (other than by virtue of serving as a director of the Company), (ii) otherwise do not have a material
interest in the Merger (other than an interest by virtue of their
59
Table of Contents
ownership of capital stock of the Company) and (iii) are disinterested with respect to the Merger, will not receive additional compensation in connection
with their services to the Company as members of the Special Committee with respect to the Merger.
Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards; Shares and Equity Awards Held by Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment set forth below with respect to the Company equity awards that are outstanding at the Effective
Time.
Company Options. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Option in writing, each Company Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts payable in respect of
Company Options will be paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger (and in no case later than the next regularly scheduled
payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time of the Merger).
The following sets forth, for each Company executive officer, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding
Company Options held by such executive officer assuming (i) the closing price of a Company Common Stock is $41.00 (the “Estimated Closing Value”), (ii)
a closing date of October 7, 2021, and (iii) such executive officer remains continuously employed with the Company or a subsidiary until the Effective
Time.

Company RSU Awards. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company RSU Award in writing, each Company
RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of Inovalon
common stock subject to such Company RSU Award, less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts payable in respect of Company RSU Award will be

Corporation).

Time. No executive officer holds Company RSU Awards.

Company RS Awards. Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Cash-Out Company RS Award in writing, each Cash-
Out Company RS Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock, subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target” level of

Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Conversion Company RS Award in writing, each Conversion Company RS
Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into a cash-based retention award in an amount, without

which cash-based retention award will remain subject to the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
applicable performance vesting criteria and requirements).
The following sets forth, for each Company executive officer, the number of shares of Cash-Out Company RS Awards and Conversion Company RS
Awards, and the value of such awards, assuming (i) the closing price of a Company Common Stock is the Estimated Closing Value, (ii) a closing date of

Change in Control Agreements; Change in Control Policy
In accordance with the requirements of Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits (on a pre-tax
basis) that each named executive officer would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such
named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination of employment on October 7, 2021 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this
golden parachute compensation disclosure), (ii) a per Share price of $41.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, (iii) that
each named executive officer’s base salary rate and annual target bonus remain unchanged from those in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and
(iv) the equity awards described below are the only equity awards outstanding as of closing. The calculations in the table below do not include any
amounts that the named executive officers were entitled to receive or that were vested as of the date hereof. In addition, these amounts do not attempt to
forecast any additional awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or any awards that, by their terms, vest
irrespective of the Merger prior to October 7, 2021. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the
relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer
may differ materially from the amounts set forth below.
For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under the Change in Control Policy to the
named executive officers, see “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation” below.
Indemnification Benefits
Each of the Company’s executive officers and directors is entitled to the indemnification benefits in favor of the Company’s directors and executive
officers, as described in more detail in “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.”

Cash. The Company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Wychulis on December 3, 2014, Jason Capitel on January 23, 2018 and
Peter De Bock on January 12, 2019, and a promotion letter with Jonathan Boldt on January 14, 2019 (such employment agreements, collectively, the
“Employment Agreements”). If we terminate the employment of a named executive officer other than for “cause” (as defined in their Employment
Agreements), subject to the named executive officer’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of us, we will provide him with a
lump-sum cash severance benefit equal to the greater of (i) one month’s base salary or (ii) one month’s base salary per each full year of his service
with us, subject to a maximum of six months’ base salary. However, as a condition of agreeing to changes to the vesting of outstanding equity
awards, including the treatment of Company RS Awards as Cash-Out Company RS Awards, each named executive officer agreed that any amounts
that would have been payable under the Employment Agreements prior to the closing date will reduce the amount payable in respect of the Cash-
Out Company RS Awards that are single-trigger payments as described below. If a named executive officer’s employment is terminated without
“cause” on the closing date, the full amount of the Cash-Out Company RS Award would be payable and no severance would be owed. On October
4, 2021 Jason B. Capitel’s and Peter De Bock’s employment ended. Amounts in this column will be paid subject to each’s execution of the
Company’s standard form of separation and release agreement.
In addition, each participant in our 2021 annual bonus program, including our named executive officers, would be entitled to his or her 2021 annual
bonus if and when annual bonuses are paid under the 2021 annual bonus program and the participant is eligible and an employee as of the 2021
annual bonus payment. These amounts would represent double trigger payments, which would be payable as a result of the occurrence of both the
consummation of the Merger and the relevant individual experiencing a qualifying termination of employment. The target bonus opportunities for
the 2021 annual bonus program for each of our named executive officers are: Dr. Dunleavy, $0, and Mr. Boldt, $281,250.
(2)
Equity. These amounts represent single-trigger payments that will occur solely as a result of the consummation of the Merger. Based on the Merger
Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable securityholder in writing (i) each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the exercise price, and the aggregate number of
shares of Inovalon common stock subject to such Company Option, less any applicable withholding taxes; and (ii) each Cash-Out Company RS
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to
receive a cash payment in an amount, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of
Inovalon common stock subject to the Cash-Out Company RS Award (with any performance-based goals deemed to be achieved at the “target”
level of performance), less any applicable withholding taxes. Amounts for Messrs Jason B. Capitel and Peter De Bock take into account the
reduction from the cash severance benefit in connection with each’s separation from employment on October 4, 2021. Set forth above in the Section
“Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company — Payments to Executive Officers in Respect of Equity Awards” are the values of
each type of unvested Company equity award held by each named executive officer as of the date of this proxy statement that would become
vested upon the consummation of the Merger based on an assumed effective time of October 7, 2021.

Effective December 31, 2020, Mr. Wychulis formally transitioned his role from President to a new position as Fellow of the Company’s Payer
Business Unit.

On October 4, 2021, Jason B. Capitel’s and Peter De Bock’s employment ended.
Intent of the Directors and Executive Officers to Vote in Favor of the Merger
Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this proxy statement, they intend to vote all of the Shares owned
directly by them in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal and each of the other proposals. As of October 13, 2021, the most recent
practicable date before this proxy statement was distributed to our
62
Table of Contents
stockholders, our directors and executive officers directly owned, in the aggregate, 2,744,001 shares of Company Class A Common Stock and 54,994,740
shares of Company Class B Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 65% of the total voting power entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting. For purposes of clarity, the Shares directly owned by the directors and executive officers shall be (i) included in determining
whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by (x) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
vote in accordance with the DGCL, (y) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the
DGCL and (z) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class B Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL; and (ii) excluded
from determining whether the Merger Agreement has been approved by a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public Stockholders.
Intent of Certain Stockholders to Vote in Favor of the Merger
The Dunleavy Entities, who hold approximately 64% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann
and Cape Capital, who collectively beneficially own approximately 23% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, separately
entered into Support Agreements with Parent, pursuant to which the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their
Shares in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. Copies of the Support Agreements are attached as Annex B of this proxy
statement and are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in their entirety. See “Special Factors — Support Agreements.” However, the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement separately requires an affirmative vote of Public Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, which excludes all shares of Company Common Stock held by Dr.
Dunleavy, Mr. Hoffmann and Cape Capital.
In the event the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change, in compliance with the Merger Agreement, prior to the Company’s receipt
of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the obligation of the Rollover Stockholders to vote the Shares listed in the Support Agreements as
described above will be modified such that the Rollover Stockholders will each have the right to so vote (x) in favor of the Merger or (y) such proportion
of Shares as votes cast by the Inovalon stockholders other than the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as applicable, with respect
to the applicable matter (such proportion determined without the inclusion of the votes cast by the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape
Capital, as applicable).
Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger to US Holders (as defined below) of the
Shares. This summary is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of US federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of the Shares in
light of their particular circumstances. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations
promulgated under the Code, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and
other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any
time, with possible retroactive effect. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following discussion, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court
will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or non-US jurisdiction, and does not consider any aspects of US federal tax law other than income taxation, nor does it address any aspects of
the unearned income Medicare contribution tax. In addition, this discussion only applies to the Shares that are held as a capital asset (generally, property
held for investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, and does not address tax considerations applicable to any holder of the Shares that
may be subject to special treatment under US federal income tax law, including:
•
a bank or other financial institution;
•
a tax-exempt organization;
•
a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account;
•
an S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an investor in an S corporation or other pass-through entity);
•
a person holding a direct or an indirect interest in Parent or Merger Sub;
•
an insurance company;
•
a mutual fund;
63
Table of Contents
•
a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust;
•
a dealer or broker in commodities, stocks, securities or in currencies;
•
a dealer or trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;
•
a controlled foreign corporation;
•
a passive foreign investment company;
•
a stockholder that owns, or has owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of the Shares;
•
a stockholder subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;
•
a stockholder that received the Shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise
as compensation;
•
a person that has a functional currency other than the US dollar;
•
a person that is required to report income no later than when such income is reported in an “applicable financial statement”;
•
a person that holds the Shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction;
•
a stockholder that is not exchanging its Shares for cash pursuant to the Merger; and
•
certain former US citizens or long-term residents.
If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds the Shares, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Any such
partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes), and any partners thereof, that hold the
Shares should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of exchanging the Shares pursuant to the Merger. In addition, holders of
Shares who are not US Holders may be subject to different tax consequences than those described below, and are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding their tax treatment under US and non-US tax laws.
The following summary is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Holders of Shares
are urged to consult their own tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger in light of their own particular
circumstances, including US federal estate, gift and other non-income tax consequences, and tax consequences under state, local and non-US tax laws.
US Holders
The following is a summary of the material US federal income tax consequences of the Merger that will apply to US Holders. For purposes of this
discussion, the term US Holder refers to a beneficial owner of the Shares that is, for US federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident in the United States;
•
a corporation (or any other entity or arrangement treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a “United
States person” under applicable Treasury regulations.
Exchange of the Shares for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The exchange of the Shares by a US Holder for cash in the Merger (or for
cash upon exercise of appraisal rights) will generally be a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes. A US Holder will generally recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger (or cash received upon exercise of appraisal rights) and the
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. Gain or loss will generally be determined separately for each block of the Shares (generally,
the Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) held by such US Holder. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if such US Holder’s holding period for the Shares is more than one (1) year at the time of the exchange. Long-term capital
gains recognized by a non-corporate US Holder are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain
limitations.
64
Table of Contents
Non-US Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-US Holder” is a beneficial owner of Shares that is neither a US Holder nor an entity or arrangement
classified as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes.
A Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for Shares pursuant
to the Merger, unless:
•
the gain is effectively connected with the Non-US Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-US Holder in the United States);
or
•
the Non-US Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the
disposition of Shares pursuant to the Merger, and certain other requirements are met.
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax on a net income basis at generally applicable US
federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such Non-US Holder were a US Holder. A Non-US Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a
branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or lower rate specified in an applicable income tax treaty, on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain
items.
Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to US federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be
specified under an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by US-source capital losses of the Non-US Holder (even though the individual is
not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-US Holder has timely filed US federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax
Proceeds from the exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Merger (or as a result of exercising appraisal rights) generally will be subject to
information reporting. In addition, backup withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 24%) generally will apply unless the applicable US Holder or
other payee provides a valid taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures (generally, by providing a properly
completed IRS Form W-9), or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding tax. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding tax rules from a payment to a US Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s US federal income tax
liability, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided, that, the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Each US Holder should duly
complete, sign and deliver to the exchange agent an appropriate IRS Form W-9 to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup
withholding tax, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent.
A Non-US Holder generally certifies its status as such by providing a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E (or other
applicable IRS Form W-8). A Non-US Holder that does not provide such form generally will be presumed to be a US Holder, subject to backup
withholding tax as described above.
Financing of the Merger
Equity Financing
The Merger Agreement does not contain any financing-related contingencies or financing conditions to consummation of the Merger. In
connection with the Merger, Parent delivered to the Company the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of August 19, 2021, entered into by and among
Parent and Nordic Capital X, 22C Capital I, L.P., 22C Capital I-A, L.P., Insight Partners XII, L.P., Insight Partners (Cayman) XII, L.P., Insight Partners
(Delaware) XII, L.P., Insight Partners (EU) XII, S.C.Sp, Insight Partners XII (Co-Investors), L.P., Insight Partners XII (Co-Investors) (B), L.P., Insight
Partners XII Buyout Annex Fund, L.P., Insight Partners (Cayman) XII Buyout Annex Fund, L.P., Insight Partners (Delaware) XII Buyout Annex Fund, L.P.,
Insight Partners (EU) XII Buyout Annex Fund, S.C.Sp, Insight Partners XII Buyout Annex Fund (Co-Investors) (B), L.P. and Ashburton Investment Pte.
Ltd. (each, an “Equity Investor” and, collectively, the “Equity Investors”). Pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, each Equity Investor has
committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, it will make, or cause to be made, directly or indirectly through Parent, as directed by
Nordic Capital X, to provide a capital investment to the Parent of up to its pro rata percentage of USD $3,175,000,000 (the “Commitment”) (in the case of
each Equity Investor, such Equity Investor’s “Equity Investment”) on or prior to the Closing of the Merger in connection with the funding of the
Transaction.
The Equity Investment will be paid in immediately available funds, subject to: (i) the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter; (ii) the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the conditions to completion of the Closing set forth in the Merger Agreement
65
Table of Contents
(other than conditions that, by their nature, can only be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, provided that each such condition is capable of and
would be satisfied assuming a Closing would occur at such time prior to the Closing); (iii) the substantially simultaneous funding by each Equity Investor
of the entirety of its Equity Investment to be funded pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter; (iv) the substantially simultaneous funding of the Debt
Financing; (v) the Merger Agreement not being terminated in accordance with its terms; and (vi) the substantially simultaneous occurrence of the
Closing, solely for the purpose of funding, and solely to the extent necessary to fund (together with the Rollover Amount (if the rollover contemplated by
the Merger Agreement is consummated), debt and cash on hand of the Acquired Companies), (A) the payments required to be made at the Closing
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (B) the payment of any and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions to be consummated at the Closing.
The Equity Commitment Letter will terminate on the earlier of:
(a)
the consummation of the transactions to be consummated at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (at which
time the obligations thereunder will be satisfied in full);
(b)
in respect of each Equity Investor, such Equity Investor having satisfied in full its obligation under the Equity Commitment Letter to fund its
Equity Investment;
(c)
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the Merger Agreement;
(d)
the date that Company or any of its Affiliates, direct or indirect equityholders, or Representatives asserts in any litigation or other
proceeding any claim against any Equity Investor or a Related Person (as defined below) relating to the Equity Commitment Letter, the
Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby (including in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection therewith) other than a claim against any Equity Investor (i) under the Limited Guarantee pursuant to the terms thereof
and subject to the limitations set forth therein, (ii) seeking specific performance of an Equity Investor’s obligation to fund its Equity
Investment in accordance with the terms thereof pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, the Merger Agreement or (iii)
relating to a breach or seeking to prevent a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement; and
(e)
any judgment against the Parent in any action permitted under clause (d) above that includes any award of money damages or the payment
of any amount due pursuant to the Limited Guarantee.
The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter if it seeks specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause the Equity
Investors to fund the Equity Investment, in each case, if and only to the extent permitted by, and subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger
Agreement. Other than the Company, there are no third-party beneficiaries to the Equity Commitment Letter. The Equity Commitment Letter may only be
enforced by (i) Parent and (ii) the Company, pursuant to its right to seek specific performance of each Equity Investor’s obligation to fund its Equity
Investment to the extent permitted by, and subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement and for no other purpose (including, without
limitation, any claim for monetary damages thereunder), and no other third party, including Parent’s creditors, will have any right to enforce the Equity
Commitment Letter or to cause Parent to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter. Each Equity Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Company may
seek specific performance of the obligations of such Equity Investor to fund its Equity Investment to Parent (and not to the Company or any other
Person) to the extent permitted by, and subject to, the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement. The parties to the Equity Commitment Letter agree
that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Equity Commitment Letter, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Equity Investors will, under no
circumstances, whether following an enforcement by the Company of any of its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter (if any) or otherwise, be
required to pay or cause to be paid any funds (whether comprising all or some of the Equity Investment or otherwise) to the Company directly, and that
required to pay or cause to be paid any funds (whether comprising all or some of the Equity Investment or otherwise) to the Company directly, and that
any such funds will require to be paid to the Parent only in accordance with the provisions of the Equity Commitment Letter.
Debt Financing
Blackstone Credit (together with funds and accounts managed or advised by it or its affiliates, “Blackstone”), Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC
(together with its affiliates and its and their managed funds and accounts, “Owl Rock”), and Apollo Global Funding, LLC (“AGF”) and Apollo Capital
Management, L.P., on behalf of one or more investment funds, separate accounts, and other entities owned (in whole or in part), controlled, managed,
and/or advised by it or its affiliates (in such capacity, “ACM” and, together with AGF, “Apollo”, and, together with Blackstone and Owl Rock, the “Debt
Commitment Parties”) have agreed to provide Parent with debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,000,000,000 on the terms set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter.
The Debt Commitment Parties have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) a seven (7) year
senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,340,000,000 (the
66
Table of Contents
“Initial Term Facility”), (ii) a five (5) year, $250,000,000 super senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), (iii) a seven (7) year senior
secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250,000,000 (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”, together with the
Initial Term Facility and the Revolving Facility, the “Unitranch Facilities”) and (iv) a twelve (12) year second lien PIK term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount equal to $660,000,000 (the “Second Lien PIK Term Facility”).
The commitments will be secured by a perfected first-priority (in the case of the Unitranche Facilities and the guarantees in respect thereof) or
second priority (in the case of the Second Lien PIK Term Facility and the guarantees in respect thereof) security interest in substantially all of the present
and after-acquired tangible and intangible assets of Parent, the direct parent company of Parent, and each of Parent’s direct and indirect wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions, exclusion and permitted liens.
The obligations of the Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary terms and
conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with all material respects with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Debt Commitment Letter, the absence of any Company Material
Adverse Effect, and certain other customary closing conditions.
If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, or there is a
breach or repudiation by any Debt Commitment Party, Parent must use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain sufficient alternative financing from
the same or alternative financing sources, on terms containing no new or additional conditions to the consummation of such financing. There are
currently no such alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans in place.
The Merger Agreement provides that Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to arrange or
obtain the debt financing as promptly as practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement and to consummate the debt financing on or prior to the
Closing Date (as defined below). Although the Merger is not conditioned on Parent’s receipt of the debt financing, the failure of Parent to obtain
sufficient debt financing may result in the failure of the Merger to be completed. In such case, Parent may be required to pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee.
Parent intends to repay the loans obtained in the debt financing by cash generated by the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Table of Contents
The Company has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability will attach to, certain related persons and affiliates of any Guarantor and
Parent and certain related persons and affiliates of any of the foregoing, in each case, not including the Parent (such parties (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Guarantor with respect to the rights of the Guaranteed Party hereunder and the Parent), each a “Non-Recourse Party” and, collectively the
“Non-Recourse Parties”), with respect to the Limited Guarantee, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Limited Guarantee or the
Merger Agreement, through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise ) by or on behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse Party by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights under the Confidentiality Agreement with
the General Partner or the rights of the Company under the Equity Commitment Letter. Except under the Confidentiality Agreement with the General
Partner, the Equity Commitment Letter to which the Guarantors are a party (subject to the limitations set forth therein) and the Merger Agreement (subject
to the limitations set forth therein), the Company and all of its controlled Affiliates recourse against the Guarantors pursuant to the Limited Guarantee
(subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein) is the sole and exclusive remedy against the Guarantors and Non-Recourse Parties in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection with the Limited Guarantee or the Merger Agreement.
The Limited Guarantee will terminate and no Guarantor will have any further obligations under the Limited Guarantee as of the earliest of (a) the
Closing, (b) receipt in full by the Company (or its designee(s) if the Company has given its prior written consent to such receipt by such designee(s)) of
the Payment Obligations of each Guarantor, (c) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (other than under
circumstances in which Parent would be obligated to pay any of its Payment Obligations) and (d) the three (3)-month anniversary of the termination of

three (3)-month anniversary, the Company has not presented a written claim for payment of any Payment Obligation to the Parent or any Guarantor by the
end of such three (3)-month period, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Company or any of its Affiliates asserts in writing in any pleading or filing with, or orally before, any Governmental Authority (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions thereof limiting any Guarantor’s liability to its Maximum Commitment or the
provisions thereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, asserts in writing in any pleading or filing with, or orally before, any
Governmental Authority in any litigation or other proceeding that any Guarantor is liable for Payment Obligations in excess of, or to a greater extent than,
its Maximum Commitment or asserts in writing in any pleading or filing with, or orally before, any Governmental Authority in any litigation or other
proceeding any theory of liability against any Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement other than liability of (w) Parent or Ocala Topco LP under the Rollover Agreement and Support Agreement, if any, to the other parties to such
agreements pursuant to the terms and conditions therein, (x) the General Partner under the Confidentiality Agreement, (y) any Guarantor under the
Limited Guarantee (as limited by the provisions thereof), or (z) any Guarantor for specific performance of such Guarantor’s obligation under the Equity

unless within five (5) Business Days within making any such assertion, the Company or applicable Affiliate withdraws such assertion, (i) the obligations
of each Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee will terminate ab initio and be null and void, (ii) if any Guarantor has previously made any payments
under the Limited Guarantee, it will be entitled to recover such payments and (iii) neither any Guarantor nor any Non-Recourse Party will have any liability

Provisions for Public Stockholders
No provision has been made (a) to grant the Company’s stockholders access to the corporate files of (i) the Company, (ii) any party to the Merger
other than Parent (and certain of its affiliates and representatives), (iii) Nordic Capital X, or (iv) any of their respective affiliates; or (b) to obtain counsel or

letters from counsel for Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Plan and Steamfitters Local 449 Retirement Security Plan seeking disclosure of certain Company
records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. On September 27, 2021, the Company received a similar letter from counsel for
City of Sarasota Firefighters’ Pension Fund.
Accounting Treatment
The Parent Entities anticipate that Parent will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. If so, Parent will use the acquisition method of
accounting to allocate the purchase consideration to the Company assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will be recorded at fair value.
Regulatory Approvals
HSR Approval
The Merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevents the parties from completing the Merger until required information and
materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and all statutory waiting period
requirements have been satisfied and/or all applicable consents have been obtained. The requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act were
filed with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on September 2, 2021 and the applicable waiting period
expired on 11:59 pm, October 4, 2021.
CFIUS Clearance
The Merger is subject to clearance of the Merger by CFIUS, which requires that the parties (i) file a declaration and furnish information to CFIUS in
accordance with the CFIUS Authorities and (ii) receive CFIUS Clearance, which requires that (a) CFIUS concludes that the Merger is not a “Covered
Transaction” and is not subject to review under the CFIUS Authorities; (b) CFIUS issues a written notice that it has completed a review or investigation
of the filed declaration, and concludes all action under the CFIUS Authorities; (c) CFIUS informs the parties that it is unable to conclude action under the
CFIUS Authorities with respect to the Merger on the basis of the declaration, but CFIUS does not request that the parties file a written notice of the
Merger and the thirty (30)-day assessment period established by CFIUS for the assessment of the declaration elapses; (d) if CFIUS requests that the
parties file a written notice of the Merger, CFIUS then concludes action pursuant to the CFIUS Authorities with respect to such written notice; or (e) if
CFIUS sends a report to the President of the United States requesting the President’s decision, (x) the President then announces a decision not to take
any action to suspend or prohibit the Merger or (y) having received a report from CFIUS requesting the President’s decision, the President does not take
any action after fifteen (15) days from the earlier of the date the President receives such report from CFIUS or the end of the investigation period. A
declaration was filed with CFIUS on September 2, 2021, and formal acceptance of the filing was received from CFIUS on September 16, 2021.
Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure that these regulatory clearances and
approvals will be timely obtained or obtained at all, or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of
additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest assets, create or modify contractual rights or obligations, or
enter into supply or services agreements. These conditions could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

(the “Silverberg Complaint”) and Alex Ciccotelli v. Inovalon Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08288 (the “Ciccotelli Complaint”), respectively.
On October 11, 2021, another purported stockholder of the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York against the Company and each member of the Company Board, captioned Dee Claybrook v. Inovalon Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-05665
(the “Claybrook Complaint”). The Clasby Complaint, Silverberg Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint collectively constitute
the “Complaints.” The Complaints allege that the Company’s Schedule 14A filed September 17, 2021 (or October 8, 2021 in the case of the Claybrook
Complaint) omits material information with respect to the Merger and that, as a result all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. The
Silverberg Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint also allege that all defendants violated Rule 14A-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The Clasby Complaint, Ciccotelli Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint additionally allege that each member of the Company Board
violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Complaints seek (i) injunctive relief; (ii) rescissory damages; (iii) plaintiff’s attorneys’ and experts’ fees
and costs; and (iv) other such relief that the court deems just and proper. The Ciccotelli Complaint, Clasby Complaint, and Claybrook Complaint
additionally seek (i) rescission in the event the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are consummated
and, (ii) in the case of the Ciccotelli Complaint and Clasby Complaint a direction that the Company Board issue a revised Schedule 14A. The Ciccotelli
Complaint and Claybrook Complaint additionally seek a declaration that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well
as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The Company believes the claims asserted in the Complaints are without merit.
Additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, the Company Board or the Company’s officers in connection with the Merger, which could
prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with indemnification.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated and certain conditions are met, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time, who do not
vote such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw
their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal, will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section
262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of Shares who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for
appraisal and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Information
about the Special Meeting — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their Shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully
and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not
seek appraisal of their Shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement; (ii) not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which you seek appraisal in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the demand through the Effective Time;
and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Company Class A Common Stock, unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the
stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Special Meeting — Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is reproduced and attached as Annex F to this proxy statement and incorporated
70
Table of Contents
by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. If you hold your Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by
such broker, bank or other nominee. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Information about the Special
Meeting — Appraisal Rights.”
Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Dunleavy Entities, which hold approximately 64% of the voting power
of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, and Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital, which collectively beneficially own approximately 23% of the
voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, separately entered into Support Agreements with Parent.
Under the Support Agreements, the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital have agreed to vote their Shares in favor of adoption
and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable Support Agreement. The obligations of the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital under the Support
Agreements will automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the mutual agreement of the parties thereto to terminate the applicable Support
Agreement, (ii) the Effective Time and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In the event the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change, in compliance with the Merger Agreement, prior to the Company’s receipt
of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the obligation of the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital to vote the Shares listed
in the Support Agreements, as described above, will be modified such that the Dunleavy Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann and Cape Capital will each have
the right to so vote (x) in favor of the Merger or (y) such proportion of Shares as votes cast by the Inovalon stockholders other than the Dunleavy
Entities, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as applicable, with respect to the applicable matter (such proportion determined without the inclusion of
the votes cast by the Dunleavy Entities or, Mr. André Hoffmann or Cape Capital, as applicable).

Rollover Agreement
On August 19, 2021, each of the Rollover Stockholders separately entered into the Rollover Agreements, pursuant to which, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Rollover Stockholders will exchange their Shares for equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc., which in turn will be exchanged for
equity interests of Ocala Topco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Rollover
Agreement.
The “Rollover Shares” are comprised of 31,707,318 shares of Class B Common Stock in aggregate, consisting of a 17,073,171 shares of Class B
Common Stock contributed by Meritas Group, Inc. and 14,634,147 shares of Class B Common Stock contributed by Cape Capital, such Rollover Shares
having an aggregate value of $1,300,000,000. The equity interests of Ocala Topco, Inc. to be received by the Rollover Holders consist of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate value equal to $1,300,000,000 based on the per share Merger Consideration, which will be
contributed by the Rollover Holders to Ocala Topco, LP in exchange for Class A Units of Ocala Topco, LP having an aggregate value equal to
$1,300,000,000.
The foregoing description of the Rollover Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete

Effective Time of the Merger
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Closing will take place on the date which is seven (7) Business Days
after the date on which all conditions to the Closing (see “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Completion of the Merger”) have been satisfied
or waived (if such wavier is permissible under the Merger Agreement or under Applicable Law) (other than any such conditions that, by their terms, are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or such other time and place as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree in writing; provided that, (i) if the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived after

December 15, 2021 but before December 22, 2021, the Closing will take place on December 30, 2021 and (ii) notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of
such closing conditions, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be required to effect the Closing prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day after the date of the
Merger Agreement unless otherwise agreed by Parent in writing in its sole discretion. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in the
Merger Agreement as the “Closing Date.”
The Merger will become effective, at the Effective Time, upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such later time specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL.
Payment of Merger Consideration
At the Effective Time, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, whereupon all such Shares will cease to be outstanding and will cease to exist, and the holders of such
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the Merger Agreement, for the benefit of holders of (i) a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (a “Certificate”) and (ii) each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Book-Entry Share”), in each case, other than the
Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares.
Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, Parent will direct the Paying Agent
to send to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than the Cancelled Shares and
except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares), (i) a letter of transmittal (which specifies that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree.
Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or delivery of a customary affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor, as promptly as practicable (but, in any event, within
three (3) Business Days), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
The Paying Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. The Paying Agent may reduce the
amount of any Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares by any applicable withholding taxes. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, and certain dividends or other distributions pertaining to
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the Merger Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.

After the completion of the Merger, you will cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive certain dividends and other distributions, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement.
None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount of Merger
Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to, or become, the property of any governmental entity, any such Shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The Merger Agreement
The following describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and which is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The descriptions in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement are subject to, and qualified in their
entirety by, reference to the Merger Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the
Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the Merger Agreement in its entirety before making any decisions
regarding the Merger because it is the principal document governing the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and are not intended to provide you with any factual information about us or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us
contained in this proxy statement or in our public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the Merger Agreement and this summary are not intended to be,
and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding the actual state of any facts and circumstances relating to the Company. Such information can be
found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings we make with the SEC, as described in the section titled “Where You Can Find More
Information.”
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of each of the parties to the Merger Agreement that were made
only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. Those representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, were qualified and subject to important limitations in connection with the negotiation of the Merger
Agreement (including by being qualified by confidential disclosure schedules and certain other disclosures exchanged between the parties to the Merger
Agreement, which are not reflected in the Merger Agreement) and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality which may differ from what may
be viewed as material by you or other investors. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement
and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of
establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to close the transactions contemplated thereby if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstances or otherwise, and allocating risk between the
parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations
and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures
by the Company. As of the date of this proxy statement, except as set forth in the Company’s public disclosures, there are no specific material facts that
exist that the Company believes materially contradicts its representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement. The Company will provide additional
disclosure in its public reports to the extent it becomes aware of the existence of any specific material facts that are required to be disclosed under US
federal securities laws and might contradict its representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement. In any event, the representations and
warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided
elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. See the section titled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this proxy statement have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Stockholders and other interested parties should read the Merger Agreement for a more complete description of the provisions summarized below.
The Merger
The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL. Upon completion of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub will automatically
cease and the Company will continue its existence as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.”
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all rights, privileges,
powers, properties and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the obligations, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Intervening Event, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that if the Intervening Event to
which this provision applies thereafter changes in any material respect or another Intervening Event occurs, the Company will provide

twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of
such modification or proposed modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting such modification or proposed
modification). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of the discussions or negotiations referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee), directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position with respect to a

such holders under the Merger Agreement, lost stockholder premium, and the time value of money), which will be deemed to be damages payable to such
party. Certain provisions specified in the Merger Agreement (including provisions described under the heading “ — Other Covenants”, provisions
related to the indemnification obligations of Parent regarding the financing cooperation, provisions described in this proxy statement under the heading “

Agreement will survive any termination of the Merger Agreement.
Termination Fees
As used in this proxy statement, “Company Termination Fee” means an amount of cash equal to $176,385,000. In the event that the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated:
•
(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Item (B)(i) of the preceding section before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval
or Item (B)(iii) of the preceding section or by Parent pursuant to Item (C) of the preceding section and (y) (A) an Acquisition Proposal has
been made to the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement and, if public, has not been withdrawn prior to the earlier of (1) the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements thereof) and (2) the date of such termination and (B)
within twelve (12) months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement for the
consummation of any Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such
consummation occurs within the twelve (12)-month period), then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its
designees), the Company Termination Fee on the date of the consummation of such transaction involving any Acquisition Proposal
(provided, however, that for purposes of this bullet, the references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will
be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”);
•
(ii) by Parent pursuant to Item (E) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its
designees) the Company Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following such termination;
•
(iii) by the Company pursuant to Item (F) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more
of its designees) the Company Termination Fee prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; or
•
(iv) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Item (B)(iii) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay to Parent (or one or more of its
designees) by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions (including all fees and
expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub) at or prior to
the time of such termination, up to $10,000,000 (the “Reimbursement Payment”). If, following the payment of any Reimbursement Payment,
the Company Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent, the amount of the Reimbursement Payment actually paid prior to such time will
offset the amount of the Company Termination Fee payable by the Company to Parent.
As used in this proxy statement, “Parent Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $368,805,000. In the event that the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Items (D) or (G) of the preceding section, or is otherwise terminated when terminable pursuant to Items
(D) or (G) of the preceding section, then Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days
following such termination.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties and any Financing Related Person in the event Parent or Merger Sub fails to consummate the
Transactions or otherwise fails to comply with or breaches any covenant or other obligation or representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement will
not exceed the Parent Liability Limit. In no event will the Company or any other Company Party seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Party or
any Financing Related Person with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Transactions (including any breach by any Guarantor or Parent Party), the termination of the Merger Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Transactions or thereby or any claims, Proceedings or actions under Applicable Laws arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure (including in the event
94

of a fraud or Willful Breach), other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for in the Merger Agreement or any Guarantor to the
extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledged and agreed that neither the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the
Reimbursement Payment is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reliance on the Merger Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
In no event will (x) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (y) Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the

specific performance of the type contemplated by the provisions described under the heading “— Specific Performance” and monetary damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or Enforcement Expenses.
Expenses
Except as described under the headings “— Termination Fees” and “— Regulatory Approvals; Third Party Consents,” each party to the Merger
Agreement will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions whether or not such Transactions will be
consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; provided, however, that in the event that the Transactions are
not consummated, Parent will pay all fees and expenses in connection with any financing arrangements, regardless of whether such financing fees and
expenses were to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that except in situations where cash payments are to be made
to a Person other than the Person whose name the applicable surrender Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, Parent will bear and timely pay all
Transfer Taxes and will prepare and timely file, at its expense, all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes.
Specific Performance
The parties agreed that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of
the provisions of the Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including failing to take
such actions as are required of it under the Merger Agreement to consummate the Transactions). Accordingly, the parties are entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each party agreed that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any
other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the
Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agreed
not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the parties to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with the Company’s enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing will be subject to the following
requirements:
•
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger described under the headings “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual
Closing Conditions” and “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Additional Parent Closing Conditions” have been and
continue to be satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which will be
capable of being satisfied at the Closing and will be satisfied at the Closing);
•
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter if the
Equity Financing is funded;
•

performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Company would take such actions required
of it by the Merger Agreement to cause the Closing to occur; and
•
Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following the delivery of such
confirmation specified in the immediately preceding bullet above (it being understood that the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to the consummation of the Merger described under the headings “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual

of the Merger Agreement), request in writing that each Third Party that has previously executed a confidentiality or similar agreement

terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company will not, directly or indirectly

(A) solicit, initiate, seek, propose, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue, initiate or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or data relating to the Acquired Companies to, or afford access to the properties,
books, records, officers or personnel of the Acquired Companies to, any Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
discussion or request that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company is be permitted to grant a waiver of or terminate any “standstill” or similar bona fide agreement or obligation of any Third
Party with respect to the Acquired Companies to allow such Third Party to submit an Acquisition Proposal if the Special Committee has
determined that failure to so waive or terminate would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
(C) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement or
Contract with respect to or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate, breach or fail to consummate the Transactions (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), or (D) resolve,
commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.
For the purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise stated, “Acquisition Proposal” means, other than the
Transactions or any other proposal or offer from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any proposal or offer from a Third Party relating to (i) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by any Third Party, whether from the Company or any other
Person(s), of assets that constitute or account for fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or net assets of the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole; (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by
any Third Party, whether from the Company or any other Person(s), of beneficial ownership (or right to acquire beneficial ownership) of securities
representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding voting power or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of Company Capital Stock of the
Company, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person other than Parent acquiring beneficial
ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of Company Capital Stock of the
Company; (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, amalgamation, reorganization, dividend, dissolution, share
exchange or other transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which a Third Party or its shareholders, if consummated, would acquire
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company or the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity; or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, but subject to compliance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement
described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation by the Company,” if, after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the
receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result
from a breach of Section 6.02(a) and that is not withdrawn and (ii) the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor),
that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (y) the Special Committee determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take the actions contemplated by clauses (A) and (B) below would be inconsistent
with the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to the execution of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (A) furnish non-public information, and afford access to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such
Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal; provided, that any non-
public information concerning the Acquired Companies made available to any Third Party will, to the extent not previously made available to Parent, be
made available to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after it is made available to such Third
Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives may, in any
event (without the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee having to make the determination in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence), contact any Third Party to (i) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by such Third Party solely to, and only to the extent necessary to, determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform such Third Party that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, of the relevant provisions of the Merger Agreement.
For the purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise stated, “Superior Proposal” means an Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to “fifteen percent (15%)” will be replaced by “fifty percent (50%)”)

made by a Third Party that the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account such factors as the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee) or the Special Committee considers to be appropriate, including all financing, legal and regulatory aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal but, for the sake of clarity, not taking into account the fact that
such Acquisition Proposal may be subject to a lower threshold for stockholder approval than the Merger, and taking into account any changes to the
terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in response to such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to the Merger Agreement, is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and, if such Acquisition Proposal were consummated, would result in a transaction
that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders than the Transactions.
Except as expressly permitted by the provisions of the Merger Agreement described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement — No
Solicitation by the Company,” neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee, as applicable, will (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger
Agreement (the “Company Board Recommendation”); (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement or fail to
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in any solicitation or recommendation statement made
on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of a tender offer providing for such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) authorize, adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to authorize, adopt, approve or recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) any
Acquisition Proposal; (iv) following receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal, fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after Parent requests in writing that the Company Board Recommendation be reaffirmed publicly, provided that, other than
any reaffirmation following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, Parent may only request one (1) reaffirmation (provided that any Acquisition Proposal that
is modified in any material respect will be considered a new and separate Acquisition Proposal); (v) make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary “stop, look and listen” communication
by the Company Board (or the Special Committee, if applicable) pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, provided that the Company does not make
any recommendation or public statement in connection therewith other than a recommendation against any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions
described in clauses (i) through (v) of this sentence, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”); or (vi) authorize, cause or permit the Company to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, but not after, the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) will be permitted, so long as the Company is not in
material violation of and subject to compliance with this section of the proxy statement titled “No Solicitation by the Company” (x) to terminate the
Merger Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal pursuant to the terms of
the Merger Agreement and/or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
Superior Proposal.
The Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable, will only be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the
Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms if, prior to the time the Required Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, but not after:
•
(A) the Company has provided, at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice (a “Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change”)
to Parent that the Company intends to take such action in response to a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.02(c) of the Merger
Agreement (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto
and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change),
which notice includes, as applicable, written notice of the material terms of such Superior Proposal, and which enabled the Company Board
or the Special Committee, as applicable, to make the determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the identity of the
Person who made such Superior Proposal and which notice will attach the most current version of the relevant transaction agreement, and,
if applicable, copies of all relevant documents relating thereto including any related financing commitments, (B) during the three (3)
Business Day period following the time of Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company will have, and
will have caused its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letters and Guaranty so
that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (C) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period
described in the preceding
84
Table of Contents
clause (B), the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), taking into account any changes to the
Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letters and Guaranty irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, in the event that the Acquisition Proposal to which this sentence applies is
thereafter modified in any material respect by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will provide written notice of and
the material terms with respect to such modified Acquisition Proposal to Parent and must again comply with this sentence and the following
sentence and provide Parent with an additional two (2) Business Days’ notice prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change or
effecting a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(h) of the Merger Agreement (and must do so for each such subsequent amendment or
modification).
•
(A) an Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) has determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial and outside legal counsel (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor),
that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; (C)
prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board (or the Special Committee, if applicable) has provided, at least
three (3) Business Days’ advance written notice (a “Notice of Intervening Event”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it
being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Intervening Event and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so
deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes
reasonably detailed information describing the Intervening Event and the reasons for the Company taking such action; (D) during such
three (3) Business Day period following the time of Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Intervening Event, the Company will have, and will have
caused its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to, and will have used reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letters and Guaranty in response to such Intervening Event; (E) following the end of
such three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause (D), the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special
Committee Financial Advisor), taking into account any changes to the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letters and Guaranty
irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Intervening Event, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that if the Intervening Event to
which this provision applies thereafter changes in any material respect or another Intervening Event occurs, the Company will provide
written notice of such modified or other Intervening Event to Parent and will again comply with this sentence and provide Parent with an
additional two (2) Business Days’ notice prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change.
For the purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise stated, “Intervening Event” means any Effect (other than an
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, proposal, request or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
facilitate, encourage or lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal) that, individually or in the aggregate, is material to the Acquired Companies,
taken as a whole, that is not known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board or Special Committee as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
which Effect (or the material consequences of which) becomes known to or by the Company Board or Special Committee prior to adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval; provided that in no event will the following constitute, or be taken into account in
determining the existence of an Intervening Event: (a) the fact alone that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published forecasts or projections
for any period, or any changes alone after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price or trading volume of shares of Company Common Stock
or (b) any event, fact or circumstance relating to or involving Parent or its Affiliates.
From and after the execution of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after (x) receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives or (y) any request for non-public information or inquiry or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives in connection with a potential Acquisition
Proposal, the Company must provide Parent with written notice, which notice will include, in the case of clause (x), the identity of the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation constituting the
Acquisition Proposal, including proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and
85
Table of Contents
any related financing commitments), and in the case of (y) the identity of the Person seeking such information or discussions or negotiations, and (ii) in
the event that any such party modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company will provide Parent with written notice within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of
such modification or proposed modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting such modification or proposed
modification). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of the discussions or negotiations referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee), directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company’s stockholders), or (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and
the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto; provided that the foregoing will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such
statement or disclosure would otherwise have under the Merger Agreement.
Any breach of the provisions of the Merger Agreement described in the section titled “No Solicitation by the Company,” by any director, officer
or Subsidiary of the Company or any action by any Representative acting on the Company’s behalf in breach of the provisions of the Merger Agreement
described in the section titled “No Solicitation by the Company,” will be deemed to be a breach of the Merger Agreement by the Company.
Parent Financing and Company Cooperation
Parent and Merger Sub have represented to the Company that the aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing, Company Cash
on Hand and the Rollover Amount will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including (i) the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
Option Consideration and RSU Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company RS
Awards will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) repayment or refinancing of the Company Credit Agreement and (iii)
the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing in connection with the Transactions.
The Company has agreed to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide)
such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent, except that the Company will not be required
to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide) such assistance that in the good faith judgment of the Company would unreasonably interfere with its or
its Subsidiaries’ business operations. Such assistance will include using its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in connection with arranging
the Debt Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts to do the following, each of which will be at Parent’s written request with reasonable
prior notice and at Parent’s sole cost and expense:
•
deliver to Parent the Debt Financing Deliverables; and
•
facilitate and assist in the preparation and negotiation of the Debt Financing Documents, including one or more credit agreements, pledge
and security agreements, guarantees, certificates (including a solvency certificate) and other definitive financing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (including furnishing all (A) information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses to be included in any schedules thereto or in any perfection certificates and (B) stock certificates and any other pledged
collateral to the extent held by the Company and its Subsidiaries); provided that (x) the foregoing documentation (or, as applicable, the
pledge of such pledged collateral) will be subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date and become effective no earlier than the Closing
Date, (y) cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing to the
extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, or is within the control of, the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
representative and (z) in no event will the Company or any of its officers, director or employees be required to approve, ratify or execute any
of the Debt Financing Documents prior to consummation of the Merger (unless contingent on the consummation of the Merger).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (v) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will be required to make any filings with the SEC in connection with the
Financing (other than this proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3), (w) nothing in this section of the proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement —
Parent Financing and Company Cooperation” will require any such
86
Table of Contents
action to the extent it would (1) unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Acquired Companies or require the Acquired Companies to
agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any indemnities, in any case prior to the Closing, for which Parent does not promptly reimburse or
indemnify it, as the case may be, under the Merger Agreement or (2) require the Company, any Company Party or their respective Representatives or
financing sources to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any Debt Financing Document prior to the Closing, (x) none of the board of directors (or
other similar governing body) of any Acquired Company will be required to adopt resolutions approving the Debt Financing Documents prior to the
Closing and consummation of the Merger (and any such adoption or approval at Closing will be performed by such board of directors (or other similar
governing body) as constituted after the Effective Time and Closing), (y) the Company’s obligations under this section of the proxy statement titled “The
Merger Agreement — Parent Financing and Company Cooperation” will be subject to the Financing Related Persons (as applicable) being bound by
confidentiality agreements in accordance with customary market practice, and (z) none of the Acquired Companies will be required to provide any
information to the extent it would (1) cause significant competitive harm to any Acquired Company if the Transactions are not consummated, (2) violate
Applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired
Company is a party, (3) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (4) violate any applicable confidentiality obligation of any Acquired
Company so long as that the Company provides Parent written notice of any information so withheld and reasonably cooperates with Parent in seeking
to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to cause such competitive harm, violate Applicable Law or Contract,
jeopardize such attorney-client or other legal privilege or violate any such confidentiality obligation.
Neither the obtaining of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter nor the obtaining of the Equity Financing under the Equity
Commitment Letter are conditions to the Closing. The parties agreed that the conditions precedent related to the Company’s obligations in the provisions
of the Merger Agreement relevant to financing cooperation would be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained as a direct result
of the Company’s Willful Breach of its obligations under such provisions.
Company Stockholder Approval
The Merger Agreement provides that, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days) after the
execution of the Merger Agreement, (i) the Company will use reasonable best efforts to prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy
statement and (ii) the Company and Parent will jointly prepare and file with the SEC a Schedule 13E-3. This proxy statement fulfills the obligation
referenced in clause (i) of the foregoing sentence. The Company will promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect to this proxy statement or Schedule 13E-3 or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the proxy statement or Schedule 13E-3. Prior to filing or mailing the proxy statement or Schedule 13E-3 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company must provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and will include any such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent; provided, however, that the Company may amend or supplement the proxy statement without the review or comment of
Parent in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change.
The Company agreed to use reasonable best efforts to duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which this proxy statement is mailed to holders of the Company Common Stock as of the Record Date (and in no event later
than the thirtieth (30th) day following the first mailing of the proxy statement to the stockholders of the Company), subject to certain scenarios for
postponement, for the purposes of obtaining the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, voting as a single class, (ii) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Shares of
Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public Stockholders (item (ii), the “Public Stockholder Approval”), (iii) a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL and (iv) of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Class B Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL (items (i) – (iv), the “Required Company Stockholder Approval”). Once the
Company has established the record date, the Company cannot change such record date or establish a different record date without the prior written
consent of Parent, unless required to do so by Applicable Law.
Unless the Special Committee has withdrawn, modified, amended or qualified its recommendation thereof or otherwise effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Company will (i) through the Company Board,
recommend, including through a recommendation in the proxy statement, that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and (ii) solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Without the prior written consent of Parent (which must not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i) the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) the stockholder advisory vote contemplated by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act and (iii) adjournment of the Company Stockholder
Meeting will be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders
in connection with the adoption of the Merger Agreement) that the Company will propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company stockholders meeting. The Company Stockholder Meeting may be adjourned or postponed, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Regulatory Approvals; Third Party Consents
Each party agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law, including Antitrust Law and the CFIUS Authorities, or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or
Proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including those in connection with the Antitrust Laws and the CFIUS Authorities), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and (iii) (A) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date the Merger Agreement, make, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its direct or indirect shareholders to make (to the extent required by Applicable Law), all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to the Merger Agreement required under the HSR Act, (B) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger
Agreement, make, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its direct or indirect shareholders to make (to the extent required by Applicable Law),
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to the Merger Agreement required under any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and the CFIUS Authorities, and (C) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, make, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its direct or indirect shareholders to make (to the extent required by Applicable Law), all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to the Merger Agreement required under any other Applicable Law. The Company and
Parent will furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any Applicable Law in
connection with the Transactions.
Each party also agreed to: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to
or from any Governmental Authority regarding the approval of the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (iv) respond as promptly as practicable to
any additional requests for information received by any party from any Antitrust Authority any other Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions or filings contemplated by Section 6.03(a); and (v) use reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain termination or expiration of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, CFIUS Clearance and such other approvals, consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or advisable under any Applicable
Laws, including any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (B) prevent the entry in any action or Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or any
other Person of any Governmental Order which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Parent will take the lead
with respect to (w) the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Applicable Law, (x) the making of any filings under the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law, (y) the process for the receipt of any necessary approvals
and (z) the resolution of any investigation or other inquiry of any such Governmental Authority. Each party further agreed to consult and reasonably
cooperate with the other parties and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other Transactions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by Applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Proceeding, each party agreed to permit Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any
Applicable Law, Parent will cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and will undertake promptly any and all action to complete lawfully
the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and all action reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid,
prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or
88
Table of Contents
threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or the issuance of any Governmental Order
that would (or to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Authority to the Transactions the absence of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent,
restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including:
•
proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition,
or the holding separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, or limiting any freedom of action with respect to, particular assets,
categories of assets or lines of business (a “Regulatory Remedy Action”); and
•
promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business, in each case, at such time as may be
necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Merger Agreement, Parent will be entitled to make additional commitments to, or agreements with, Governmental Authorities to delay
the Closing following the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any commitment to, or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority not to close the Transactions before a certain date (but in no event to delay the Closing beyond the End Date) if
such delay is reasonably necessary in order to prevent a Governmental Authority from continuing to investigate the Transactions, imposing
conditions or remedies with respect to the Transactions or commencing a Proceeding.
Takeover Laws
The parties agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable
to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute and Section 203 of the DGCL on the Merger and the Transaction. Unless the Merger Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to the
section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement — Termination,” no Adverse Recommendation Change will change, or be deemed to
change, the approval of the Special Committee for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.
Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action suit, Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, would
have been permitted under or required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements as in
effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and that have been made available to Parent (an “Indemnification Agreement”) or other organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to indemnify such person. Parent also agreed to promptly
advance expenses as incurred by each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies to the fullest extent permitted under
or required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, Indemnification Agreements or other organizational documents
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement to advance expenses incurred by such Person upon receipt of a
written undertaking by such Person or on such Person’s behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such Person is
not permitted to be indemnified under Applicable Law, organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Indemnification Agreement.
Parent also agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in the
Acquired Companies’ respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Acquired Companies’ former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of Applicable Law and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, Indemnification
Agreements, and other organizational documents of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii)
not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case,
except as required by Applicable Law.
89
Table of Contents
For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on terms not
less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that (i) the Company may and (if the Company does not) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation must cause coverage to be extended under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the
Closing Date a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year “tail” policy (containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage)
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any Proceeding is asserted or made against those Persons who are
currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on or prior to the sixth (6th) year anniversary of the
Effective Time, any insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this section of the proxy statement will be continued in respect of such claim until the
final disposition thereof, except that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an aggregate or total premium amount in excess of 350% of the amount per annum the Company paid for such coverage in its last full fiscal year.
The provisions regarding indemnification of directors and officers set forth the provisions of the Merger Agreement described in this section titled
“The Merger Agreement – Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance” will survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and will be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will
succeed to the obligations set forth in the preceding two (2) paragraphs. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agreed not distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its
obligations under the provisions of the Merger Agreement described in this section titled “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification; Directors’ and
Officers’ Insurance.”
Stockholder Litigation
The Company has agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis regarding any stockholder litigation or similar Proceeding against
the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions (the “Merger Litigation”), whether commenced prior to or after the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement. The Company will give Parent (a) the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made before such
filings or responses are made by the Company in connection with the Merger Litigation (and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account) and (b) the opportunity to participate, at its expense, in the defense or settlement of any such Merger Litigation, and the Company will not
settle, or offer to settle, any such Merger Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section titled “The Merger Agreement — Stockholder Litigation,” nothing in the Merger
Agreement will require the Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, in each case, so long as that the Company provides Parent written notice
of any information so withheld and reasonably cooperates with Parent in seeking to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not
reasonably likely to jeopardize such attorney-client or other legal privilege.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Proceeding related to Dissenting Shares will be governed by the provisions described under section titled “The
Merger Agreement — Dissenters’ Rights” above.
Other Covenants
The Merger Agreement contains other customary covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants relating to public announcements and other
public statements, notice of certain events, Section 16 matters, resignation of directors and officers, termination of contracts, access to information and
confidentiality.
Conditions to the Completion of the Merger

•
the consummation of the Merger will not then be enjoined, restrained or prohibited by any Proceeding, Governmental Order, judgment,
decree, injunction or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any Governmental Authority. No Law will have been enacted,
issued, entered, promulgated or enforced by any Governmental Authority that prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the Merger and
continues to be in effect.
Additional Company Closing Conditions
The obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger is further conditioned upon the satisfaction (or written waiver by the Company, if
permissible under Applicable Law) at or prior to the Closing of each of the following conditions:
•
each of the representations and warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub (without giving effect to any references to materiality
qualifications) being true and correct in all respects, in each case, at and as of the date of the Merger Agreement and at and as of the
Closing as if made at and as of the Closing, in each case, (i) except for representations and warranties that speak as of a particular date,
which must be true and correct in all respects as of such date and (ii) except where the failure to be so true and correct has not had and

conditions set forth in the preceding bullets have been satisfied.

Sub, if so permissible under Applicable Law) at or prior to the Closing of each of the following conditions:
•
the representations and warranties of the Company:

regarding certain elements of our corporate existence and power, corporate authorization and the Required Company Stockholder
Approval (the “Company Fundamental Representations”) being true and correct in all material respects, in each case, at and as of the

warranties that speak as of a particular date, which must be true and correct in all respects as of such date;
•
made by the Company in the Merger Agreement other than the Company Fundamental Representations (without giving effect to any
references to any “Company Material Adverse Effect” or other “materiality” qualifications) and the representations and warranties
made by the Company regarding certain elements of our capital structure, the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect since
December 31, 2020 and the absence of brokers’ and advisors’ fees being true and correct in all respects, in each case, at and as of the
date hereof and at and as of the Closing as if made at and as of the Closing, in each case, (A) except for representations and
warranties that speak as of a particular date, which must be true and correct in all respects as of such date and (B) except where the
failure to be so true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;
•
regarding certain elements of our capital structure and the absence of brokers’ and advisors’ fees being true and correct in all
respects, except for de minimis inaccuracies, in each case at and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing as if made at and as

•
Parent will have received a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by its authorized representative to the effect that the conditions

Merger Sub, on one hand, or the Company, on the other hand to perform any of its material obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Termination
The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time
notwithstanding receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval (except as expressly noted below), only as follows:
A.
By mutual written agreement of the Company (upon approval of the Special Committee) and Parent;
B.
By either the Company (upon approval of the Special Committee) or Parent, if:

Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this item may not
be exercised by any party whose failure to perform any covenant or obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the principal
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the End Date; provided, further, that if any of the
conditions to the Closing related to the HSR Act or the CFIUS Clearance (or with respect to any Proceeding, Governmental Order,

January 16, 2022, but all other conditions to Closing set forth in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement —

failure to perform any covenant or obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the
issuance of such order, decree or ruling;
iii.

Company Stockholder Approval will not have been obtained;

and (iii) such Terminating Parent Breach is not capable of cure prior to the End Date or at least thirty (30) days have elapsed since the date

Agreement — Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual Closing Conditions” and “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to
the Completion of the Merger — Additional Parent Closing Conditions” (other than conditions which are to be satisfied by actions taken

other party setting forth the basis on which such party is terminating the Merger Agreement.
Except as described set forth in this sentence, the following sentence and under the heading “ — Termination Fees,” in the event of the valid
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the provisions described in this section “ — Termination,” the Merger Agreement will forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or the Financing Related Persons or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, other than (subject to the provisions described under the heading “ — Termination Fees” below) liability of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, for fraud or any Willful Breach of the Merger Agreement occurring prior to such termination;
provided, that notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary (including, for clarity, anything described in this sentence and the
following sentence), in no event will the Parent Parties have any monetary liability or obligation under the Merger Agreement in the event the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the provisions described in this section “ — Termination” (including any monetary liability or obligation
pursuant to provisions related to the indemnification obligations of Parent regarding the financing cooperation, the Financing, described in this proxy
statement under the heading “ — Termination” or described in this proxy statement under the heading “ — Expenses and Termination Fees”) in an
aggregate amount greater than the sum of (i) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and (ii) $7,500,000 (such sum, the “Parent Liability Limit”). Subject
to the previous sentence, in determining losses or damages recoverable upon termination by a party hereto for the other party’s breach, the parties
acknowledged and agreed that such
93
Table of Contents
losses and damages will not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by such party
or, in the case of the Company, the holders of Company Common Stock (taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to
such holders under the Merger Agreement, lost stockholder premium, and the time value of money), which will be deemed to be damages payable to such
party. Certain provisions specified in the Merger Agreement (including provisions described under the heading “ — Other Covenants”, provisions
related to the indemnification obligations of Parent regarding the financing cooperation, provisions described in this proxy statement under the heading “
— Termination,” and provisions described in this proxy statement under the heading “ — Expenses and Termination Fees”) and the Confidentiality
Agreement will survive any termination of the Merger Agreement.
Termination Fees
As used in this proxy statement, “Company Termination Fee” means an amount of cash equal to $176,385,000. In the event that the Merger
Agreement is validly terminated:
•
(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Item (B)(i) of the preceding section before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval
or Item (B)(iii) of the preceding section or by Parent pursuant to Item (C) of the preceding section and (y) (A) an Acquisition Proposal has
been made to the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement and, if public, has not been withdrawn prior to the earlier of (1) the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements thereof) and (2) the date of such termination and (B)
within twelve (12) months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement for the
consummation of any Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such
consummation occurs within the twelve (12)-month period), then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its
designees), the Company Termination Fee on the date of the consummation of such transaction involving any Acquisition Proposal
(provided, however, that for purposes of this bullet, the references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal will
be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”);
•
(ii) by Parent pursuant to Item (E) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its
designees) the Company Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following such termination;
•
(iii) by the Company pursuant to Item (F) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more
of its designees) the Company Termination Fee prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; or
•
(iv) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Item (B)(iii) of the preceding section, then the Company will pay to Parent (or one or more of its
designees) by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions (including all fees and
expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub) at or prior to
the time of such termination, up to $10,000,000 (the “Reimbursement Payment”). If, following the payment of any Reimbursement Payment,
the Company Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent, the amount of the Reimbursement Payment actually paid prior to such time will
offset the amount of the Company Termination Fee payable by the Company to Parent.
As used in this proxy statement, “Parent Termination Fee” means a cash amount equal to $368,805,000. In the event that the Merger Agreement is
validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Items (D) or (G) of the preceding section, or is otherwise terminated when terminable pursuant to Items
(D) or (G) of the preceding section, then Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days
following such termination.
The maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties and any Financing Related Person in the event Parent or Merger Sub fails to consummate the
Transactions or otherwise fails to comply with or breaches any covenant or other obligation or representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement will
not exceed the Parent Liability Limit. In no event will the Company or any other Company Party seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Party or
any Financing Related Person with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Transactions (including any breach by any Guarantor or Parent Party), the termination of the Merger Agreement, the
failure to consummate the Transactions or thereby or any claims, Proceedings or actions under Applicable Laws arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure (including in the event

of a fraud or Willful Breach), other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for in the Merger Agreement or any Guarantor to the
extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty.
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledged and agreed that neither the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the
Reimbursement Payment is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reliance on the Merger Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.
In no event will (x) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (y) Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the
provisions described under the heading “— Specific Performance” and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the provisions described
under the heading “ — Expenses,” as the case may be, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance of the type contemplated by the provisions described under the heading “— Specific Performance” and monetary damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or Enforcement Expenses.
Expenses
Except as described under the headings “— Termination Fees” and “— Regulatory Approvals; Third Party Consents,” each party to the Merger
Agreement will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Transactions whether or not such Transactions will be
consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; provided, however, that in the event that the Transactions are
not consummated, Parent will pay all fees and expenses in connection with any financing arrangements, regardless of whether such financing fees and
expenses were to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that except in situations where cash payments are to be made
to a Person other than the Person whose name the applicable surrender Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, Parent will bear and timely pay all
Transfer Taxes and will prepare and timely file, at its expense, all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes.
Specific Performance
The parties agreed that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of
the provisions of the Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including failing to take
such actions as are required of it under the Merger Agreement to consummate the Transactions). Accordingly, the parties are entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law
or in equity. Each party agreed that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any
other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the
Merger Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agreed
not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the parties to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with the Company’s enforcing Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing will be subject to the following
requirements:
•
all conditions to the consummation of the Merger described under the headings “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual
Closing Conditions” and “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Additional Parent Closing Conditions” have been and
continue to be satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which will be
capable of being satisfied at the Closing and will be satisfied at the Closing);
•
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter if the
Equity Financing is funded;
•
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice that (i) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (ii)
all of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger described under the
95
Table of Contents
headings “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual Closing Conditions” and “— Conditions to the Completion of the
Merger — Additional Parent Closing Conditions” have been satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing, which are capable of being satisfied at the Closing and will be satisfied at the Closing) and that the specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Company would take such actions required
of it by the Merger Agreement to cause the Closing to occur; and
•
Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following the delivery of such
confirmation specified in the immediately preceding bullet above (it being understood that the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to the consummation of the Merger described under the headings “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Mutual
Closing Conditions” and “— Conditions to the Completion of the Merger — Additional Parent Closing Conditions” (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which will be capable of being satisfied and will be
satisfied at the Closing) will remain satisfied at the close of business on such third (3rd) Business Day).
Amendment and Waiver
Any provision of the Merger Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time (except for the provision containing the closing
condition that the Required Company Stockholder Approval will have been obtained prior to Closing in order for the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to
be required to fulfill their respective obligations, which may not be waived by any party) if, but only if, the Company Special Committee approves of such
amendment or waiver and such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to the Merger Agreement or,
in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that the requirement that the Required Company
Stockholder Approval include the Public Stockholder Approval must not be amended or waived; provided, further, that (i) no amendment or waiver will be
made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval or receipt of approval of the Merger Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub which requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company or of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub pursuant to the
DGCL or otherwise without such further stockholder approval and (ii) any amendment or waiver with respect to the Company must first be approved by
the Company Special Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Merger Agreement, the Lender Protective Provisions (or any
defined term used in any such Lender Protective Provision, to the extent of the application of such defined term to such Lender Protective Provision)
contained in the Merger Agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects the Debt Financing or any
Financing Related Person without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in
the Merger Agreement will be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.
Governing Law
The Merger Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

Voting
Stockholders of Record
If your Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered,
with respect to those Shares, the stockholder of record or record holder. This proxy statement and proxy card have been sent to you directly by the
Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote electronically at the Special Meeting. If
you have requested printed proxy materials, we have enclosed a proxy card for you to use.
If you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either electronically at the Special Meeting or by proxy, your Shares will not be voted at
the Special Meeting, and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Additionally, if you do not attend the Special Meeting and fail to vote, either electronically at the Special Meeting or by proxy, your failure to vote
will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative vote of
holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, with holders of
Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock voting together as a single class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class B Common
Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL and (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock, voting as a single
class, held by the Public Stockholders, and (b) have no effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal (so long as a quorum is present) or the Adjournment
Proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).
Beneficial Owners
If your Shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those Shares held in “street name.” In
that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those Shares, the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your Shares by
following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may
not vote these Shares electronically at the Special Meeting unless you submit a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.
Your broker, bank or other nominee will be permitted to vote your Shares only if you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote.
You should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding the voting of your Shares. Under applicable stock exchange
rules, absent your instructions, a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on “non-routine” matters, and all the
matters to be considered at the Special Meeting are, under such rules, “non-routine.” As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of
such Shares, your broker, bank or other nominee is not empowered to vote such Shares.
If you instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote on at least one, but not all the proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting,
your Shares will be voted according to your instructions on those proposals for which you have provided instructions, and will be counted as present for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. In this scenario, a “broker non-vote” will occur with respect to each other
proposal for which you did not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.
A failure to provide instructions with respect to any of the proposals or a broker non-vote will (a) have the effect of counting “AGAINST” the
Merger Agreement Proposal with respect to the approval threshold requiring the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, with holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Company
Class B Common Stock voting together as a single class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in
accordance with the DGCL, (iii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class B Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL
and (iv) a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock, voting as a single class, held by the Public Stockholders; (b) have no
effect on the Golden Parachute Proposal; and (c) have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal (regardless of whether a quorum is present).

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time, who do not vote such Shares in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and who do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise
lose their rights of appraisal, will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”).
The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex F, and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The
following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal
rights under Section 262. All references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of Shares unless otherwise
expressly noted herein. Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal of such Shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having
a beneficial interest in Shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps set forth in Section 262 (and summarized below) properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold
your Shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, and if you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with such broker, bank or other
nominee.
Under Section 262, if the Merger is completed, holders of Shares who: (i) submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is
taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) do not submit a proxy with respect to, or otherwise vote, the Shares for which such holders seek
appraisal in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (iii) continue to hold such Shares of record on and from the date of the making of the
demand through the Effective Time; and (iv) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, will
be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such Shares, exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be
fair value, if any, as determined by the court. The Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings with respect to the Company Class A Common
Stock unless: (a) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock held by stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock; or (b) the value of the aggregate per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock held by stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1,000,000 (conditions (a) and (b) referred to as the “ownership thresholds”). Unless the Delaware Court
of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the
Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during such period. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving
Corporation may voluntarily pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, in which case,
such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair
value” of the Shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary cash
payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of
judgment.
107
Table of Contents
Under Section 262, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty
(20) days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders, who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes
the Company’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex F, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. In connection with the Merger, any holder of Shares who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex F carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her, its
or their appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the per Share Merger Consideration described in the Merger Agreement, without interest thereon.
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of any Shares, that if a stockholder considers exercising
such rights, that stockholder is encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the summary of
Section 262 contained herein and Section 262, Section 262 will govern.
Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to an appraisal of their Shares must do ALL the following:
•
NOT vote the Shares for which appraisal is sought in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•
deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of such Shares before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting,
which written demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder who intends to demand appraisal of his, her,
its or their Shares, and that such stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such Shares;
•
continuously hold such Shares on and from the date of making the demand through the Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal
rights if the stockholder transfers the Shares before the Effective Time);
•
file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of such Shares within 120 days after the
Effective Time. This may be undertaken by the stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust
or by a broker, bank or other nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so; and
•
otherwise comply fully with the conditions established by Section 262.
In addition, with respect to the Company Class A Common Stock, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from
voting.
Making a Written Demand
Any holder of Shares wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the
stockholder’s Shares, and that stockholder must not vote such Shares or submit a proxy for such Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. A holder of Shares exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the Shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must
continue to hold the Shares of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked,
be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights for such
stockholder’s Shares must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting, with
respect to such Shares. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote against
the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Only a holder of record of Shares is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the Shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in
respect of Shares must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably
108
Table of Contents
inform the Company of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s Shares in connection with
the Merger. If the Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be
executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the Shares are owned of record by more than one (1) person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in
common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two (2) or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly
disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker, bank or other
nominee who holds Shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more
beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought, and where no number of
shares is expressly mentioned it will be presumed to cover all Shares held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares through a broker
who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depositary nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by
or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record holder.
STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE
APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A
PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR
OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to the Company at 4321 Collington Road, Bowie, MD
20716, and may not be submitted by electronic submission. Such written demand must be delivered to and received by the Company before the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
Any holder of Shares who has delivered a written demand to the Company and who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her, its or their demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger
Agreement by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made
more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this does not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to
accept the per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.
If an appraisal proceeding is commenced and the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal
when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in
the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a
stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less
than, equal to or more than the per Share Merger Consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of Shares who has
properly made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the
Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of Shares who has complied with Section 262
and is otherwise entitled to seek appraisal under Section 262 (including for this purpose any beneficial owner of the relevant Shares) may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed
by a stockholder (or beneficial owner), demanding a determination of the fair value of the Shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal.
The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the Surviving
Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
109
Table of Contents
Shares. Accordingly, any holders of Shares who desire to have their Shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights
in respect of their Shares within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Shares to file such a petition within the
period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Shares who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and who is otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights thereunder will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of Shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which the Company has received demands for
appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such Shares. The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder within
ten (10) days after receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of Shares held either in a voting trust or by a broker, bank or other
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the
foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of Shares and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation will then be obligated, within twenty (20) days after such service, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their Shares
have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the written statement described above at the
addresses stated therein. Such notice will also be published at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the court. The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving
Corporation. After notice to stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their Shares to submit their stock certificates (if any) to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and, if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have
asserted appraisal rights if neither of the ownership thresholds is met.
Determination of Fair Value
The appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the Shares, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly
and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal
proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after
the time of such payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the Shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time.
In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass
110
Table of Contents
known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their Shares
and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an
opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value
higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither the Company nor Parent anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration
to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, the Company reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section
262 and each of the Company and Parent reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a
Share is less than the per Share Merger Consideration. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and charged upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses
of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the Shares entitled to be appraised. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party
bears its own expenses.
If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her, its or their Shares under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively loses or withdraws, such
holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation an effective written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.
From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such Shares for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder’s Shares, if any, payable to
stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a
written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with
the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with
the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing will not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights."""

THE MERGER
(THE MERGER PROPOSAL — PROPOSAL 1)
The Proposal
The Company is asking you to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.
General
We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, the holders of Shares
(other than the holders of Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) will have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration of $41.00 per share of Company Common Stock in cash, without interest, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement. For a detailed description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, see
“The Merger Agreement.”
As discussed in the section entitled “Special Factors — Purpose and Reasons of the Company for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company
Board and the Special Committee; Fairness of the Merger,” the Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) has determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and
the Company’s stockholders.
Our stockholders must approve the Merger Agreement Proposal in order for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to approve the Merger
Agreement Proposal, the Merger will not occur.
Vote Required
The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of: (i) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Stock
entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, with holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock voting together as
a single class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, (iii) a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Class B Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL and (iv) the affirmative vote of Public
Stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of outstanding Company Common Stock held by the Public Stockholders, with holders of Company
Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock voting as a single class.
Each record holder of Company Class A Common Stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Company Class A Common Stock owned of
record on the Record Date and each record holder of Company Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Company Class B
Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold Shares through the Effective Time, who do not vote such Shares in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of such Shares and do not effectively withdraw their demands or otherwise
lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to an appraisal of such Shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means
that holders of Shares who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter effectively withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the
procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have such Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of such Shares, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (or in certain
circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Special Meeting — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference
between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek
appraisal of their Shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.

MERGER RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
(THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE PROPOSAL — PROPOSAL 2)
The Proposal
The Company is asking you to approve the Golden Parachute Proposal.
General
As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is providing its stockholders with the opportunity
to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the “Golden parachute Compensation” table and the footnotes to that table contained
in the section captioned “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation.”
The Company believes that those certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger
are reasonable and demonstrate that the Company’s executive compensation program was designed appropriately and structured to ensure the retention
of talented executive officers and a strong alignment with the long-term interests of the Company’s stockholders. This vote is not intended to address
any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation that may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger. In addition, this vote is separate and independent from the vote of stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal.
The Company asks that its stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that certain compensation arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the “Golden parachute Compensation” table and the footnotes to that table contained in the
section captioned “Special Factors — Interests of Executive Officers and Directors of the Company in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation,” is hereby APPROVED on a non-binding, advisory basis.”
This vote is advisory and, therefore, it will not be binding on the Company, nor will it overrule any prior decision or require the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) to take any action. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, the Company’s named executive officers may be
or become entitled to certain compensation arrangements in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in this proxy statement. However, the Company
Board values the opinions of the Company’s stockholders, and to the extent that there is any significant vote against the Golden Parachute Proposal, the
Company Board will consider stockholders’ concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. The Company
Board will consider the vote of a majority of the votes cast “FOR” the foregoing resolution as non-binding, advisory approval of certain compensation
arrangements for the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.
Vote Required
The approval of the Golden Parachute Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the Shares present at the Special
Meeting, attending the Special Meeting virtually or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon.
The holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class. Each record holder of
Company Class A common stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Company Class A common stock owned of record on the Record Date and
each record holder of Company Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Class B common stock owned of record on the

General
The Company is asking you to approve a proposal to approve one or more proposals adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement Proposal.
If the Company stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, the Company could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of
the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously
returned properly executed proxies voting against the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal (other than in respect of any proposal for which the
vote has been taken and the polls have been closed at the Special Meeting). Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean
that, even if the Company had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger
Agreement Proposal would be defeated, the Company could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to
convince the holders of those Shares to change their votes to votes in favor of any such proposal. Additionally, the Company may seek to adjourn the
Special Meeting if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting.
Vote Required
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the Shares present at the Special
Meeting, attending the Special Meeting virtually or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, whether or not a quorum is present.
The holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class. Each record holder of
Company Class A common stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Company Class A Common Stock owned of record on the Record Date and
each record holder of Company Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Company Class B Common Stock owned of record
on the Record Date.
Vote Recommendation
The Company Board (other than Dr. Dunleavy, who recused himself) recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

financing, legal and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal but, for the sake of
clarity, not taking into account the fact that such Acquisition Proposal may be subject to a lower threshold for stockholder approval than the Merger, and
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in response to such Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to Section 6.02(d), is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, and, if such Acquisition Proposal were consummated, would
result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders than the Transactions.

Sub or the Company or their respective stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but excluding any Rollover Shares, Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $41.00 per share of Company Common Stock (such amount of cash, as

13
Table of Contents
(c) Cancellation of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Rollover Shares) that are
owned directly by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or held in treasury of the

retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.
(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution thereon with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.01(e) shall be construed to permit any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.01(a)).

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a nationally recognized financial institution (the identity and terms of appointment of which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as Paying Agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover
Shares. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited (i) with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the “Exchange Fund”), (ii) with the Company, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Option Consideration, RSU Consideration,
and RSA Consideration in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Compensatory Award Fund”);
provided that the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the written request of Parent, deposit with the Paying Agent at the Closing such
portion of the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration, RSU Consideration or RSA Consideration from the Company Cash on Hand as specified in
such request. In the event the Exchange Fund or the Compensatory Award Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with the
Merger contemplated by Section 3.01 or Section 3.05, respectively, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional funds with the
Paying Agent or the Company, as applicable, in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make the applicable payment. The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.01 out of the
Exchange Fund. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Consideration, RSU Consideration, and RSA Consideration contemplated
to be paid pursuant to Section 3.05 out of the Compensatory Award Fund. The Exchange Fund and the Compensatory Award Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.
(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, Parent will direct the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or customary and effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for
the Merger Consideration in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree.
(c) Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or delivery of a customary affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in
14
Table of Contents
exchange therefor and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.
(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 2:00 p.m. Eastern time (or such other time as may be mutually
agreed in writing by Parent and the Company) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the “DTC Payment”), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after such time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.
(e) Registered Holders. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any
Transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Share or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.
(f) No Transfers; No Further Ownership. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be automatically cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article III.
(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
after the date which is one (1) year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who has not exchanged his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any Merger Consideration in respect of such holder’s shares of Company Common
Stock. Other than any Transfer Taxes described in Section 3.02(e), Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Paying Agent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person, including any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Compensatory Awards, including for any Merger Consideration, Option Consideration, RSU Consideration, and RSA Consideration
that is required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this Article III, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
15
Table of Contents
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest, gain or other income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee
as directed by Parent.
(i) All Merger Consideration, Option Consideration, RSU Consideration, and RSA Consideration issued or paid upon conversion of the Company
Common Stock, the Company Options, Company RSU Awards, or the Company RS Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company Options,
Company RSU Awards, or Company RS Awards, as the case may be.
Section 3.03 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article III.
Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation consideration
payable to any holder or former holder of Company Compensatory Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior notice to the Company of any such deduction or withholding (other than (i) withholding because of the
compensatory nature of the applicable payment or (ii) U.S. backup withholding) and shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to minimize or
eliminate such deduction or withholding to the extent permitted by Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely and properly
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.
Section 3.05 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards.
(a) Company Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time:
(i) Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company Option in writing, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the
right solely to receive an amount in cash, if any and without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (such amount, the “Option Consideration”), less any applicable
withholding Taxes. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes, to each
holder of such a Company Option through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and
in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation that is at least five (5) Business Days following the
Closing Date).
(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
the Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.
(b) Company RSU Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company RSU Award in writing, effective as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding immediately prior thereto shall, by virtue of the Merger,
automatically and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right solely to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU Award and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amount,
the “RSU Consideration”), less any applicable withholding Taxes. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the RSU Consideration, less
applicable withholding Taxes, to each holder of such a Company RSU Award through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation as soon as
practicable following the Closing
16
Table of Contents
Date (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date).
(c) Company RS Awards. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and the applicable holder of a Company RS Award in writing, effective as of

its sole stockholder, which will be effected by written consent immediately following the execution of this Agreement), and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or for each of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State). Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, this Agreement has been duly and validly executed

each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

as applicable and (ii) adopting this Agreement and the Transactions. Parent, acting in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will immediately
after execution hereof approve and adopt this Agreement.
(c) No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any Equity Securities of Parent is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise required by Parent’s organizational documents, Applicable Law or any
Governmental Authority.
Section 5.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than

requirements of the Antitrust Laws, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable
U.S. state or federal securities, takeover or “blue sky” Laws, including the filing of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, (iv) compliance with any
applicable rules of Nasdaq, (v) the filing of the CFIUS Declaration and (vi) where failure to take any such actions or filings would not reasonably be
expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.
Section 5.04 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the
consummation by each of Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions and the compliance by each of Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of
this Agreement does not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations and filings referred to in
Section 5.03 have
30

been obtained or made, any applicable waiting periods referred to therein have terminated or expired and any condition precedent to any such consent
has been satisfied or waived, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any Applicable Law or (iii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.03, require any consent by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any Contract, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such
violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration, cancellation or loss that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.
Section 5.05 Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or threatened, lawsuits, actions, suits, claims or other proceedings
at law or in equity or investigations before or by any Governmental Authority against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected
to materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.
There is no unsatisfied judgment or any open injunction binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.
Section 5.06 No Brokers. Except for Goldman Sachs and Citibank, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other financial intermediary that
has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any of Parent or its Subsidiaries who will be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or its
Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, in connection with the Transactions.
Section 5.07 Ownership of Company Capital Stock.
(a) Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company
Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company except pursuant to this
Agreement.
(b) Except as set forth on Section 5.07 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Support Agreements or the Rollover Agreements, neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (i) any stockholder of the Company
would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration, or (ii) any stockholder of the Company (A)
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (B) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any
Acquisition Proposal.
(c) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any “affiliate” or “associate” (as such terms are used in Section 203 of the DGCL) thereof “own” (within the
meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL) or have, within the last three (3) years, “owned” any shares of Company Common Stock (or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock).
Section 5.08 Financial Capacity. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (a) the executed equity commitment letter dated
as of the date hereof (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) from the Guarantors to provide to Parent on the Closing Date the Equity Financing in cash in an
aggregate amount of at least $3,175,000,000 which Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereto and
(b) the executed Debt Commitment Letter. None of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement. The
aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing, Company Cash on Hand and the Rollover Amount will be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including (i) the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RSU Consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSU Awards, and Company RS Awards will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) the repayment or refinancing of the Company Credit Agreement and (iii) the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent or Merger Sub at Closing in connection with the Transactions. The commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub, represent valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and each other party thereto (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) to provide the financing contemplated thereby
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts that are
31
Table of Contents
due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or default on the part of Parent or any other party thereto under
any term of the Commitment Letters which would reasonably be expected to materially impair or adversely affect the Debt Financing. Parent has no reason
to believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of any of the Commitment Letters. Except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than
the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that
will be included in the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to
Parent on the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub expressly agree and acknowledge that their obligations hereunder, including Parent’s and Merger
Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Parent’s or Merger Sub’s receipt of financing.
Section 5.09 Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of any Acquired Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is solvent as of the date of the Closing Date, assuming (a) the truth
and accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in Article IV (without giving effect to any “material”, “materiality”, “Company Material
Adverse Effect”, “knowledge” or similar qualifiers or exceptions contained therein), (b) that any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been prepared by them in good faith based upon assumptions that were, and continue to be, reasonable, (c) the Company complies
in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement, (d) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are solvent immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (e) satisfaction of the conditions to the Parent and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Merger, and each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in
this Section 5.09, the term “solvent” means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and
Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub
and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such
debts mature and become absolute, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section 5.09, “debt” means any liability on a
claim, and “claim” means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such
breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured.
Section 5.10 Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. All of the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value
$0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. Except for obligations or liabilities
incurred in connection with its formation and the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective Time have incurred, directly or
indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or
arrangements with any Person.
Section 5.11 Company Arrangements. Other than as contemplated by this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Support Agreements
and the Rollover Agreements, as of the date hereof, none of Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective executive officers, directors or Affiliates, has
entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the executive officers, directors or Affiliates of the Company relating in any way to
the Transactions or the operations of the Company.
Section 5.12 Investment Intention. Parent is acquiring through the Transactions the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own
account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any “blue sky” Laws and
cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any applicable “blue sky” Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such
registration.

Section 5.13 No Additional Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives makes, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
they have not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub by or on behalf of any of the Company in
connection with the Transactions, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives in certain “data rooms” or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions.

Table of Contents
Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a breach of Section 6.02(a)
and that is not withdrawn and (ii) the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) or the Company Special Committee

good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take the actions contemplated by clauses (A) and (B) below would be inconsistent with
the directors’ fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to the execution of a customary
confidentiality agreement with such Third Party that contains provisions that in the aggregate are no less favorable to the Company than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement and that does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide
any disclosure to Parent required pursuant to this Section 6.02 (each, an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”) (A) furnish non-public information,
and afford access to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations

the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) or the Company Special Committee having to make the determination in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence), contact any Third Party to (i) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by such
Third Party solely to, and only to the extent necessary to, determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform such Third Party that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal of the provisions of this Section 6.02.

propose to authorize, adopt, approve or recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) following
receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal, fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after
Parent requests in writing that the Company Board Recommendation be reaffirmed publicly, provided that, other than any reaffirmation following receipt

shall be considered a new and separate Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.02(c)); (v) make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary “stop, look and listen” communication

Proposal (any of the actions described in clauses (i) through (v) of this Section 6.02(c), an “Adverse Recommendation Change”), or (vi) authorize, cause
or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, but not after, the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee) shall be permitted, so long as the Company is not in material violation of this Section 6.02 and subject to compliance with
Section 6.02(d), (x) to terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal pursuant to Section 8.01(h) and/or (y) to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Superior Proposal.
(d) The Company Board or the Company Special Committee, as applicable, shall only be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) if, prior to the time the Required Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, but not after:

to Parent that the Company intends to take such action in response to a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.02(c) (it being understood that the
delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice,
amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes, as applicable, written notice of

material terms of such Superior Proposal which enabled the Company Board or the Company Special Committee, as applicable, to make the
determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person who made such Superior Proposal and which notice
shall attach the most current version of the relevant transaction agreement, and, if applicable, copies of all relevant documents relating thereto
including any related financing commitments, (B) during the three (3) Business Day period following the time of Parent’s receipt of the Notice of
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Commitment Letters and Guaranty so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (C) following
the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause (B), the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Company
Special Committee) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special
Committee Financial Advisor), taking into account any changes to this Agreement and the Commitment Letters and Guaranty irrevocably offered in
writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that in the event that the Acquisition
Proposal to which this provision applies is thereafter modified in any material respect by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall provide written notice of and the material terms with respect to such modified Acquisition Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with this
Section 6.02(d) and provide Parent with an additional two (2) Business Days’ notice prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change or
effecting a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (and shall do so for each such subsequent amendment or modification).
(ii) (A) an Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial and outside legal counsel (including the Special Committee Financial
Advisor), that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; (C)
prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee, if applicable) has provided, at
least three (3) Business Days’ advance written notice (a “Notice of Intervening Event”) to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it
being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Intervening Event and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such
notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes reasonably detailed
information describing the Intervening Event and the reasons for the Company taking such action; (D) during such three (3) Business Day period
following the time of Parent’s receipt of the Notice of Intervening Event, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its directors, officers,
employees and Representatives to, and shall have used reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters
and Guaranty in response to such Intervening Event; (E) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause
(D), the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial and outside legal advisors (including the Special Committee Financial Advisor), taking into account any changes to this Agreement,
the Commitment Letters and Guaranty irrevocably offered in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Intervening Event, that the failure to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that if the
Intervening Event to which this provision applies thereafter changes in any material respect or another Intervening Event occurs, the Company
shall provide written notice of such modified or other Intervening Event to Parent and shall again comply with this Section 6.02(d)(ii) and provide
Parent with an additional two (2) Business Days’ notice prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change.
(e) From and after the execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after (x) receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives or (y) any request for non-public information or inquiry or any discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated with, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives in connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent with written notice, which notice shall include, in the case of clause (x), the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation constituting the Acquisition
Proposal, including proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any related financing commitments), and in the case of (y) the identity of the
Person seeking such information or discussions or negotiations, and (ii) in the event that any such party modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any material
respect, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the
fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such modification or proposed

modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting such modification or proposed modification). The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of the discussions or negotiations referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (upon the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee), directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company’s stockholders), or (ii) making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; provided that the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such statement
or disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement.
(g) Any breach of this Section 6.02 by any director, officer or Subsidiary of the Company or any action by any Representative acting on the
Company’s behalf in breach of this Section 6.02 will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses,

promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, make, and use commercially reasonable efforts

consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or advisable under any Applicable Laws, including any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (B)
prevent the entry in any action or Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order which would
prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Parent shall take the lead with respect to (w) the scheduling of, and strategic
planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law, (x) the making of any filings under the HSR
Act or any other Applicable Law, (y) the process for the receipt of any necessary approvals and (z) the resolution of any investigation or other inquiry of

prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by Applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each
party hereto will permit Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any Applicable
Law, Parent shall cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and shall undertake promptly any and all action to complete lawfully the
Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and all action reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent,
eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or the
issuance of any Governmental Order that would (or to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Authority to the Transactions the absence
of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including (i) proffering and consenting and/or
agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding separate of, or other limitations
or restrictions on, or limiting any freedom of action with respect to, particular assets, categories of assets or lines of business (a “Regulatory Remedy
Action”) and (ii) promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business, in each case, at such time as may be
necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to make additional commitments to, or agreements with, Governmental Authorities to delay the Closing following the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any commitment to, or agreement with, any Governmental Authority not to close the
Transactions before a certain date (but in no event to delay the Closing beyond the End Date) if such delay is reasonably necessary in order to prevent a
Governmental Authority from continuing to investigate the Transactions, imposing conditions or remedies with respect to the Transactions or
commencing a Proceeding.
(d) Parent shall be solely responsible for and pay all costs incurred in connection with obtaining any consents or approvals of the type described
in this Section 6.03.
Section 6.04 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting.
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form, as required by the Exchange Act,
relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”) and the Company and
Parent shall jointly prepare and file a Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC. Except as contemplated by Section 6.02, the Proxy Statement shall include the
Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Proxy Statement shall include all material disclosure relating to the Special Committee
Financial Advisor as required by Applicable Law. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts so that the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 will comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in no event more than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the SEC confirms that it
has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and shall include any such
comments reasonably proposed by Parent; provided, however, that the Company may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the review or
comment of Parent in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change.
(b) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, use reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub as may be requested in writing by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement, including such information that is required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and shall otherwise assist and reasonably cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of
39
Table of Contents
the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon written request of the Company, reasonable
best efforts to confirm and/or supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at
the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, such
information shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) In accordance with the Company’s organizational documents and the requirements of the NASDAQ, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.04(c) and the timing contemplated in Section 6.04(a)),
(x) conduct a “broker search” in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act and establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company
Stockholder Meeting”) and (y) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting a
Proxy Statement and all other proxy material (such date, the “Proxy Date”) and if necessary to comply with applicable securities Laws, after the Proxy
Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental, or supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection there with,
re-solicit proxies. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date (and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day following the first mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company); provided, however, that the Company may, with the written consent of Parent, postpone, recess or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting (and shall postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting at the request of Parent in the event of clauses (ii), (iii) or
(iv) of this Section 6.04(c)): (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, or (iv) after consultation with Parent to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board (acting on the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under Applicable Laws or fiduciary duty and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Company’s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Once the Company has
established the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting
as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise
approved in writing, it shall implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law. Unless the Company
Board (acting on the recommendation of the Company Special Committee) shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to solicit the Required Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Required
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to, and in accordance, with Article VIII, this Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of Company Capital Stock for the
purpose of obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (i) the adoption of this Agreement, (ii) the stockholder advisory vote contemplated by Rule 14a-21(c)
under the Exchange Act and (iii) adjournment of the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters) which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the holders of Company Capital Stock at the Company Stockholder Meeting.
(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Company’s or Parent’s
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3, such party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 which shall have become
false or misleading.
(e) The Company covenants and agrees that the Proxy Statement (including the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy and any
other document incorporated or referenced therein, in each case including any amendments or supplements thereto) at the date mailed to the Company’s
stockholders and at the time of any meeting of the
40
Table of Contents
Company’s stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger or Schedule 13E-3, when it is filed with the SEC, will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to (i)
statements therein relating to Parent and its Affiliates, including Merger Sub, or based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement or (ii) any financial projections or forward-looking statements. The Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 (and any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto) will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other applicable federal securities
Laws.
(f) Parent covenants and agrees that the information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, at the date mailed to the Company’s stockholders and at the time of the meeting of the Company’s
stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Section 6.05 Access to Information. Subject to confidentiality obligations and similar restrictions that may be applicable to information furnished
to the Acquired Companies by Third Parties that may be in the Acquired Companies’ possession from time to time, from the date hereof until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and its Representatives and Debt Financing Sources reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such manner as to not interfere in any
material respect with the normal operation of the Acquired Companies, to their respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns,
records and appropriate officers and employees of the Acquired Companies, and shall furnish such Representatives with existing financial and operating
data and other information concerning the affairs of the Acquired Companies as such Representatives may reasonably request; provided, that such
investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall be at Parent’s sole cost and expense; provided, further, that nothing herein shall require the
Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
(i) cause significant competitive harm to any Acquired Company if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) violate Applicable Law or the provisions of
any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired Company is a party or (iii) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege, in each case, so long as that the Company provides Parent written notice of any information so withheld and
reasonably cooperates with Parent in seeking to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to violate Applicable Law,
breach such confidentiality obligations, cause such competitive harm, breach such confidentiality obligations or jeopardize such attorney-client or other
legal privilege; provided, further, that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental testing involving
sampling of soil, groundwater or building materials, or other similar invasive techniques at any of the Acquired Companies’ properties. All information
obtained by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation or access
permitted pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.
Section 6.06 Confidentiality; Public Announcements. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by Section 6.02(f) (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Company, the Company Special Committee or the Company Board under Section 6.02), prior to any
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or public
announcement prior to obtaining the other parties’ consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent
shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may (in the opinion of outside counsel) be required by Applicable Law, Governmental Order or applicable
stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth therein or herein, the parties agree
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time it shall automatically terminate effective as of the
Closing and will be of no further force or effect. Before any document or other written communication prepared by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to be publicly disclosed, posted or made accessible on the website of the Company (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast,
hyperlink or otherwise), that is related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if reviewed by a stockholder of the Company,
could reasonably be deemed to constitute a “solicitation” of “proxies” (in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the Exchange Act) with respect to the
Merger (a “Merger Communication”) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media, employee, client, customer or other Third Party or
otherwise made accessible on the website of the Company or such participant (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise),
or (ii) utilized by any executive officer, key employee or advisor of the Company or any such participant, as a script in discussions or meetings with any
such Third Parties, the
41
Table of Contents
Company shall (or shall cause any such participant to) reasonably determine in good faith whether that communication constitutes “soliciting material”
that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act and shall promptly inform Parent of such determination. The Company
shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel on any such
Merger Communication.
Section 6.07 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, would have been permitted under or required by
Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement and that
have been made available to Parent (an “Indemnification Agreement”) or other organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on
the date of this Agreement to indemnify such person. Parent also agrees to promptly advance expenses as incurred by each present and former director,
officer and employee of the Acquired Companies to the fullest extent permitted under or required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of
incorporation, bylaws, Indemnification Agreements or other organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this
Agreement to advance expenses incurred by such Person upon receipt of a written undertaking by such Person or on such Person’s behalf to repay the
amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not permitted to be indemnified under applicable Law, organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Indemnification Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in the Acquired Companies’ respective certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Acquired Companies’ former and current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than
the provisions of Applicable Law and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, Indemnification Agreements, and other organizational documents of the
Acquired Companies, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Applicable Law.
(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors’ and officers’
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that (i) the Company may and (if the Company does not)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause coverage to be extended under the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance by obtaining at or
prior to the Closing Date a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year “tail” policy (containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any Proceeding is asserted or made against those
Persons who are currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies on or prior to the sixth (6th) year
anniversary of the Effective Time, any insurance required to be maintained under this Section 6.07 shall be continued in respect of such claim until the
final disposition thereof; provided, further, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an aggregate or total premium amount in excess of 350% of the amount per annum the Company paid for such coverage in its last full fiscal
year.
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 6.07 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its
obligations under this Section 6.07.
Section 6.08 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RS Awards, Company RSU Awards or
42
Table of Contents
other securities in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.
Section 6.09 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis regarding any stockholder litigation
or similar Proceeding against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions (the “Merger Litigation”), whether commenced prior to
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent (a) the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be
made before such filings or responses are made by the Company in connection with the Merger Litigation (and the Company shall in good faith take such
comments into account) and (b) the opportunity to participate, at its expense, in the defense or settlement of any such Merger Litigation, and the
Company shall not settle, or offer to settle, any such Merger Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).
Section 6.10 Employee Matters.
(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Employee Acknowledgement and Release from
each employee holding any Company RS Awards, which release, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include a release of all applicable claims against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates. The Company shall, within a reasonable period of time, provide Parent with a copy of each such executed
Employee Acknowledgement and Release once obtained.
(b) In event the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment of annual bonuses under the Company’s 2021 annual bonus program, Parent and its
Affiliates shall cause each Continuing Employee to be paid such Continuing Employee’s 2021 annual bonus pursuant to the terms and conditions set
forth in such 2021 annual bonus program previously made available to Parent and set forth on Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such
2021 annual bonuses shall be paid no later than the earlier of the date on which such 2021 annual bonuses would have otherwise been paid in accordance
with the terms of the 2021 Bonus Program and the date required by Code Section 409A, subject to the Continuing Employee’s continued employment
through the payment date; provided, however, that a Continuing Employee shall remain entitled to such Continuing Employee’s 2021 annual bonus if
such Continuing Employee is terminated without “cause” or resigns for “good reason” (each, as defined in the employee’s employment agreement, the
Executive Change in Control Severance Plan or the Company Stock Plans, as applicable), in either event, prior to the payment date, subject to such
Continuing Employee’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company, Parent and each of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates.
(c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.10
shall create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for
any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Plans, or other compensation
or benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) amend any Plans or other
employee benefit plans or arrangements.
Section 6.11 Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or
approvals required in order to consummate the Transactions pursuant to the terms of any Contract or any Company License to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Prior to the Closing, at the written request of Parent, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
consent under any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to the extent required so that no default (or right of termination) exists or
arises thereunder in connection with or as a result of or following the Merger.
Section 6.12 Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any written
notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions,
and (iii) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party’s Knowledge, threatened against,
43

relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or the Transactions; provided,

such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.
Section 6.13 Stock Exchange Delisting. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company’s securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-

conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make any investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 6.15 Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub covenant and agree that, between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, Parent and

the Company;
(b) shall not acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if
such business competes in any line of business of the Acquired Companies and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk
of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering a Governmental Order
prohibiting the consummation of Transactions, (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Governmental Order on appeal or otherwise or
(iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions; and
(c) shall not prior to the End Date, enter or agree to enter into any definitive agreement for the acquisition of any business or Person or take or
agree to take any other action which, in either case, would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with their ability to pay or make available to the
Paying Agent and the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time funds sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.05, the
payment of all associated costs and expenses, or that otherwise would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the performance by Parent or Merger
Sub of its obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

occurrence of the Closing Date and become effective no earlier than the Closing Date, (y) cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent set
forth in any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, or is within the control

employees be required to approve, ratify or execute any of the Debt Financing Documents prior to consummation of the Merger (unless contingent
on the consummation of the Merger);
provided that (v) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will be required to make any filings with the SEC in connection with the Financing (other
than the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3), (w) nothing in this Section 6.16 shall require any such action to the extent it would (1) unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Acquired Companies or require the Acquired Companies to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses or give any indemnities, in any case prior to the Closing, for which Parent does not promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as the case may be,
under this Agreement or (2) require the Company, any Company Party or their respective Representatives or financing sources to execute, deliver or enter
into, or perform any Debt Financing Document prior to the Closing, (x) none of the board of directors (or other similar governing body) of any Acquired
Company shall be required to adopt resolutions approving the Debt Financing Documents prior to the Closing and consummation of the Merger (and any
such adoption or approval at Closing shall be performed by such board of directors (or other similar governing body) as constituted after the Effective
Time and Closing), (y) the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.16 shall be subject to the Financing Related Persons (as applicable) being bound
by confidentiality agreements in accordance with customary market practice, and (z) none of the Acquired Companies shall be required to provide any
information to the extent it would (1) cause significant competitive harm to any Acquired Company if the Transactions are not consummated, (2) violate
Applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired
Company is a party, (3) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (4) violate any applicable confidentiality obligation of any Acquired
Company so long as that the Company provides Parent written notice of any information so withheld and reasonably cooperates with Parent in seeking
to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that is not reasonably likely to cause such competitive harm, violate Applicable Law or Contract,
jeopardize such attorney-client or other legal privilege or violate any such confidentiality obligation.
(b) The Company shall have the right to review and comment on marketing materials used in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing prior to the dissemination of such materials to potential lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or filing with
any Governmental Authority) and no such materials shall contain information that would result in the requirement to make any filing with the SEC;
provided, that the Company shall communicate in writing its comments, if any, to Parent and its counsel within a reasonable period of time under the
circumstances and consistent with the time accorded to other participants who were asked to review and comment on such marketing materials. The
Company shall not be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing and that does not
terminate without liability to the Company and its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement. The Company shall not be required to deliver or
cause the delivery of any legal opinions, authorization and representation letters or take any action that (in its good faith determination) could result in
liability to it or its officers or directors in connection with the Financing.
(c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies, and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, from and

efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such

amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace any of the Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Document except for
substitutions and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall consult with and keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Parent shall not take any action that

stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger at such time, (iii) the Company shall have given Parent written notice at least three (3) Business
Days prior to such termination stating that the Company’s intention is to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(i) and (iv) Parent fails to
consummate the Closing at the end of such three (3) Business Day period;
(j) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01 (other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give a written notice of
such termination to the other party setting forth the basis on which such party is terminating this Agreement.
Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 8.02 and Section 8.03, in the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part
of any party hereto or the Financing Related Persons or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, other than (subject to
Section 8.03) liability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, for fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination; provided, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including, for clarity, anything set forth in this Section 8.02), in
no event shall the Parent Parties have any monetary liability or obligation under this Agreement in the event this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01 (including any monetary liability or obligation pursuant to Section 6.16(c), Section 6.17, this Section 8.02 or Section 8.03) in an
aggregate amount greater than the sum of (i) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and (ii) $7,500,000 (such sum, the “Parent Liability Limit”). Subject
to the previous sentence, in determining losses or damages recoverable upon termination by a party hereto for the other party’s breach, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and may include the
benefit of the bargain lost by such party or, in the case of the Company, the holders of Company Common Stock (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including the total amount payable to such holders under this Agreement, lost stockholder premium, and the time value of money), which shall
be deemed to be damages payable to such party. The provisions of Sections 6.06, 6.16(c), 8.02, 8.03, Article IX and the Confidentiality Agreement, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.
Section 8.03 Expenses; Termination Fee.
(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.03 and this Section 8.03, each party hereto shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions whether or not such Transactions shall be consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and
accountants; provided, however, that in the event that the Transactions are not consummated, Parent shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with
any financing arrangements, regardless of whether such financing fees and expenses were to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, further, that except as set forth in Section 3.02(e), Parent shall bear and timely pay all Transfer Taxes and shall prepare and timely file, at its
expense, all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Company Termination Fee. If, but only if, this Agreement is validly terminated:
(i) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b) before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval or Section 8.01(d)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and (y) (A) an Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company after the date hereof and, if public, has
not been withdrawn prior to the earlier of (1) the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements
thereof) and (2) the date of such termination, and (B) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement for the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless
of whether such consummation occurs within the twelve (12)-month period), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or
more of its designees), the Company Termination Fee on the date of the consummation of such transaction involving any Acquisition Proposal
(provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 8.03(b)(i), the references to “fifteen percent (15%)” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to “fifty percent (50%)”);
(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its designees), the
Company Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following such termination;
(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or one or more of its designees)
the Company Termination Fee prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination; or
(iv) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(d), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more of its designees) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates of all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including all fees and expenses of financing sources, counsel,
accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants to Parent and Merger Sub) at or prior to the time of such termination, up to $10,000,000
(the “Reimbursement Payment”). If, following the payment of any Reimbursement Payment, the Company Termination Fee becomes payable to
Parent, the amount of the Reimbursement Payment actually paid prior to such time shall offset the amount of the Company Termination Fee payable
by the Company to Parent.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 9.02, Parent’s right to receive from the Company the
Company Termination Fee and Enforcement Expenses shall, in circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is owed, constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against (i) the Company and (ii) any of the Company’s former, current and future Affiliates, assignees,
stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and other Representatives (the Persons described in clauses (i) and
(ii), collectively, the “Company Parties”) for any breach, loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and such other amounts, if any, referenced in
Section 8.03(g), no Person shall have any rights or claims against the Company Parties under this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in
contract in tort or otherwise, and the Company Parties shall not have any other liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction. If
the Company becomes obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(b), upon payment of the Company Termination Fee,
neither the Company nor any Company Party shall have any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 8.03(c) shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in
which the Company or any other Company Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transaction (including the Financing). For the avoidance of
doubt, while Parent or Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.02 and the payment of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(b), as the case may be, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.02 and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the
Company Termination Fee or Enforcement Expenses. Parent shall have right to assign the right to receive all or any portion of the Company Termination
Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.
(d) Parent Termination Fee. If, but only if, this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(i), or is
otherwise terminated when terminable pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(i), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent
Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following such termination.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than Section 6.16(c)), the Company’s right to receive from Parent the Parent
Termination Fee and Enforcement Expenses shall, in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is owed, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company against (i) Parent, (ii) Merger Sub,
51
Table of Contents
(iii) any of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s former, current and future Affiliates, assignees, stockholders, limited partners, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and other Representatives (the Persons described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Parent Parties”) and (iv)
any Financing Related Person, in each case for any breach, loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for
a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Enforcement Expenses and such other
amounts, if any, referenced in Section 8.03(g), no Person shall have any rights or claims against the Parent Parties or any Financing Related Person under
this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise (including in the event of fraud or Willful Breach), and the Parent
Parties and the Financing Related Persons shall not have any other liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction, except in
respect of the obligations set forth in Section 6.16(c). If Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(d), upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, neither Parent nor any Parent Party or any Financing Related Person shall have any liability or obligation to the
Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 8.03(e) shall in any way expand or
be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent, any other Parent Party or any Financing Related Person may be liable under this
Agreement or the Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated
by Section 9.02 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(d), as the case may be, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.02 and monetary damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or Enforcement Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties and any Financing Related Person in the event Parent or Merger Sub fails to consummate the
Transactions or otherwise fails to comply with or breaches any covenant or other obligation or representation and warranty in this Agreement shall not
exceed the Parent Liability Limit. In no event will the Company or any other Company Party seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Party or
any Financing Related Person with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Transactions (including any breach by any Guarantor or Parent Party), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Transactions or thereby or any claims, Proceedings or actions under Applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure (including in the event of a fraud or Willful Breach), other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or
any Guarantor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guaranty.
(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Sections 8.02 and 8.03 are an integral
part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Reimbursement
Payment is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall (x) the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or (y)
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
(g) Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.03(b), Section 8.03(e) or this Section 8.03(g) shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds in
accordance with this Section 8.03 to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable (at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date such
fee is to be paid). If the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to pay when due any amount payable under Section 8.03(b) or Section 8.03(e), as
applicable, and in order to collect such amount, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Company Termination Fee, Parent for the Parent Termination Fee or Reimbursement Payment, as applicable, then such party shall
reimburse the other for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in
connection with such suit (any such amount, the “Enforcement Expenses”); provided that in no event shall the Enforcement Expenses payable by the
Company, on the one hand, or the Enforcement Expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, exceed $7,500,000 in the aggregate.

or to such other address, electronic mail address or facsimile number for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section
9.01; provided that any notice received by facsimile transmission or electronic mail or otherwise at the addressee’s location on any Business Day after
5:00 P.M. (addressee’s local time) or on any day that is not a Business Day shall be deemed to have been received at 9:00 A.M. (addressee’s local time) on
the next Business Day; provided, further, that notice of any change to the address or any of the other details specified in or pursuant to this Section 9.01
shall not be deemed to have been received until, and shall be deemed to have been received upon, the later of the date specified in such notice or the date
that is one (1) Business Days after such notice would otherwise be deemed to have been received pursuant to this Section 9.01.
Section 9.02 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions). It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any
other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that
the right of the parties to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with the Company’s enforcing Parent’s and
Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Closing shall be subject to the following requirements: (a) all conditions in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 have been
and continue to be satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which shall be capable
of being satisfied at the Closing and will be satisfied at the Closing), (b) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity Financing is funded, (c) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice
that (i) the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (ii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 have been
satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which shall be capable of being satisfied at
the Closing and will be satisfied at the Closing) and that the if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are
funded, then the Company would take such actions required of it by this
54
Table of Contents
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur, and (d) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Closing prior to the third Business Day following
the delivery of such confirmation specified in clause (c) above (it being understood that the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied and will be satisfied at the Closing) shall remain satisfied at the
close of business on such third (3rd) Business Day).
Section 9.03 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements (to the extent
such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires performance prior to the Closing) in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto
by any Person shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as provided in Section 8.02, upon the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01, as the case may be, except that this Section 9.03 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms expressly
contemplates performance after the Effective Time or after termination of this Agreement, including those contained in Section 6.07 and Section 6.10
following the Effective Time.
Section 9.04 Amendments and Waivers.
(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time (except for Section 7.01(a), which may not be waived by
any party) if, but only if, the Company Special Committee approves of such amendment or waiver and such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
provided, however, that the requirement that the Required Company Stockholder Approval include the Public Stockholder Approval shall not be
amended or waived; provided further, that (i) no amendment or waiver shall be made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder
Approval or receipt of approval of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub which requires further approval of the stockholders
of the Company or of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub pursuant to the DGCL or otherwise without such further stockholder approval and (ii) any
amendment or waiver with respect to the Company must first be approved by the Company Special Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Lender Protective Provisions (or any defined term used in any such Lender Protective Provision, to the extent of the application of
such defined term to such Lender Protective Provision) contained in this Agreement may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in any manner
that adversely affects the Debt Financing or any Financing Related Person without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.
(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.
Section 9.05 Disclosure Letter References. The parties hereto agree that any reference on a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any Company SEC Document shall be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such disclosure in such Company SEC Document that such disclosure is
applicable to such section of the Company Disclosure Letter. The listing of any matter on a party’s Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material. No disclosure in a party’s Disclosure Letter relating to any possible
breach or violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a party’s Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of
such party’s representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement.
Section 9.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.
(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by each party hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided,
55

however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the past, present and future officers, directors and employees of the Acquired Companies (and their
successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Section 6.07, (ii) from and after the Effective Time and
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Articles II and III, (iii) the Financing
Related Persons shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the Lender Protective Provisions and the rights of the Parent Parties
hereunder may be pledged to the Financing Related Provisions pursuant to the Debt Financing, (iv) the Parent Parties shall be shall be intended third-
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Section 8.03(b) and (v) the Company Parties shall be shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, Section 8.03(d).
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of
Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that each of Parent and Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (a) one or more of its Affiliates at any time and (b) after the Effective Time, to
any Person; provided that any assignment by Parent or Merger Sub shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 9.06(b) shall be null and void.
Section 9.07 Governing Law. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, the Transactions, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof (including as it relates to (a) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect (and whether or not a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred) and (b) the determination of whether the Closing has been consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, which will, in
each case, be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of Laws thereof), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Related Persons in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the Transactions, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision thereof that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such courts,

permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) that any Proceeding of any kind or nature,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against a Financing Related Person in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the

Section 9.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Rollover Agreements, the Support Agreements and each of
the other documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection with the Transactions, including each of the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.
Section 9.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that
the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations contained in Section 8.03(f) and Section 8.03(g) be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party’s liability or obligations hereunder or under the Debt Commitment Letter,
Equity Commitment Letter or Guaranty.
Section 9.13 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto and no Parent Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the Guaranty or Equity Commitment Letter) shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the
Company agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the Guaranty or Equity Commitment
Letter).

B-1
Table of Contents
cause to be voted) all Shareholder Shares or (as appropriate) execute written consents in respect thereof, either (x) as provided in clause (i) above; or (y)
in the same proportion as votes cast (or written consents executed) by the shareholders of the Company other than Shareholder with respect to the
applicable matter (such proportion determined without inclusion of the votes cast by Shareholder) on any matter presented for approval by the
Company’s shareholders regarding (A) the Merger, the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby and (B) any agreement (including,
without limitation, any amendment of any agreement), amendment of the Company’s organizational documents or other action that is intended or would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger. Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be
given) by Shareholder in accordance with such procedures relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including for purposes of determining

Company Common Stock such that such subsidiary ceases to be a subsidiary of Shareholder (subject to the proviso of this Section 1(b))) (i) except for an
Exempt Transfer or pursuant to the Rollover Agreement, sell, transfer, give, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (collectively, “Transfer”), or
enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the Transfer of, any Shareholder Shares (or any right, title or
interest thereto or therein), (ii) deposit any Shareholder Shares into a voting trust or grant any proxies or enter into a voting agreement, power of attorney
or voting trust with respect to any Shareholder Shares, (iii) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of Shareholder set forth in
this Agreement untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing, disabling or delaying Shareholder from performing any of its obligations under this
Agreement (except to the extent otherwise permitted by this Agreement) or (iv) agree (whether or not in writing) to take any of the actions referred to in

power of such entity, in each case, where the Shareholder has the right (contractually or otherwise) to control such entity (the “Controlled Affiliates”);
provided, that each Shareholder shall control, directly or indirectly, all voting rights with respect to any shares transferred in connection with an Exempt
Transfer. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be considered a Controlled Affiliate.

Affiliate and each of its and their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall instruct and direct, and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause, its other Representatives:

request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue, initiate or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information or data relating to the Acquired Companies to, or afford access to the
properties, books, records, officers or personnel of the Acquired Companies to, any Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
discussion or request that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (C) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse, recommend or execute any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or (E) resolve, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval, if (and only if) the
Company is permitted, pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, to have discussions or negotiations with a Third Party in response to a
proposal related to an Acquisition Proposal, the Shareholders, their Controlled Affiliates and their Representatives, including in their capacity as
beneficial owners of the Shareholder Shares, shall be permitted to participate in such discussions or negotiations with such Third Party making such
proposal to the same extent as the Company is permitted to do so under Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement.
(d) Information for Proxy Statement; Publication. Shareholder consents to the Company and Parent publishing and disclosing in any filing
required under Applicable Law, including the filings contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Shareholder’s identity and ownership of Company Common

the Company to publish and disclose in the Proxy Statement or any other disclosure document required in connection with the Merger Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, Schedule 13e-3) the Shareholder’s identity and beneficial ownership of the Shares and
the nature of the Shareholder’s commitments under this Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law, provided that (i) the any such disclosure in

shall not issue any press release or make any other public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Transactions, the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Applicable Law (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, any filing by Shareholder on
Schedule 13D and any other filings required pursuant to applicable securities laws).
(e) Waiver of Appraisal Rights. The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, all appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (and any other appraisal, dissenters’ or similar rights) related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger

both) under any contract, agreement, arrangement

the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, as applicable, and (b) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of the Shareholder’s

following such termination, on the first to occur of (a) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the End Date, (c)
the Effective Time, and (d) the entry, without the prior written consent of the Shareholders, into any amendment, waiver, modification or other change to
any provision of the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits, annexes or schedules thereto) that reduces the amount or changes the form of the

direct or indirect acquisition of record or beneficial ownership of additional shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock by the
Shareholders after the date hereof (including pursuant to a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution or any change in Company
Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, reorganization, combination, reclassification, exchange of shares or similar transaction), all of which
shall be considered Shares and be subject to the terms of this Agreement as though owned by such acquiring Shareholder on the date hereof.
7. Miscellaneous.
(a) Action in Shareholder Capacity Only. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement is entered into by each Shareholder solely in its
capacity as direct or indirect owner of the Shareholder Shares and that nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or limit the ability of such

Common Stock constituting Shareholder Shares shall be adjusted appropriately and this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall attach to any
additional shares of Company Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company issued to Shareholders in connection therewith.

(d) Definition of “Beneficial Ownership”. For purposes of this Agreement, “beneficial ownership” with respect to (or to “own beneficially”)
any securities shall mean having “beneficial ownership” of such securities (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), including
pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, without regard to the 60-day limitation in Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i).
(e) Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of Parent, and without further consideration, Shareholder shall promptly execute
and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably required to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(f) Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Rollover Agreements and each of the
documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection with the Transactions constitute the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is
not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights hereunder.
(g) Assignment; Binding Effect. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 7 shall be null and void.
(h) Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, except by a written agreement executed by the parties
hereto. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no action shall be taken by or on behalf of the Shareholders under or with
respect to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Company and the Special Committee.
(i) Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Applicable Law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
(j) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received counterparts hereof signed by the other parties hereto.
(k) Descriptive Headings. Headings of sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and shall be
given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any of the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective Affiliates arising out of or relating to the Merger

of services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York and the appellate courts thereof, (B) not to bring or permit any of their affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any
other courts, other than a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, (C) to waive and hereby waive, to the

presented for approval by the Company’s shareholders regarding (A) the Merger, the Merger Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby and

Company is permitted, pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, to have discussions or negotiations with a Third Party in response to a
proposal related to an Acquisition Proposal, the Shareholders, their Controlled Affiliates and their Representatives, including in their capacity as
beneficial owners of the Shareholder Shares, shall be permitted to participate in such discussions or negotiations with such Third Party making such
proposal to the same extent as the Company is permitted to do so under Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement.

default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration) (whether after the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both) under any contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment to which Shareholder is a party or which is binding on it or its assets and will not result
in the creation of any Lien on any of the assets or properties of Shareholder (other than the Shareholder Shares), except for such violations, breaches,

Shareholder of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) At the Contribution Closing, the Rollover Stockholder will be the record and beneficial owner of such Rollover Shares opposite the Rollover
Stockholder’s name on Annex A, free and clear of any and all Liens other than restrictions under applicable federal and state securities Laws. Upon the
closing of the Topco Contribution as contemplated hereunder, Topco LP will acquire good title to such Rollover Shares, free and clear of all Liens other

(c) The Rollover Stockholder represents that it is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under Regulation D of the
Securities Act.
(d) The Rollover Stockholder has had an opportunity to fully evaluate an investment in the New Topco Units, is in a financial position to hold the
New Topco Units for an indefinite period of time and is able to bear the economic risk and withstand a complete loss of the Rollover Stockholder’s
investment in the New Topco Units.
(e) The New Topco Units to be received by the Rollover Stockholder at the Contribution Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be
acquired by it for investment only for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part thereof in
violation of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities Laws. The Rollover Stockholder has no current intention of selling, granting participation
in or otherwise distributing the New Topco Units in violation of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities Laws.
(f) The Rollover Stockholder understands that the offer and sale of the New Topco Units and Topco Stock, as applicable, have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any applicable U.S. state or foreign securities Laws, and that the New Topco Units and Topco Stock, as applicable, are being
issued in reliance on an exemption from registration, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent
and the accuracy of the Rollover Stockholder’s representations as expressed herein.
(g) The Rollover Stockholder understands that there will be substantial restrictions on the transferability of the New Topco Units and that on the
date of the Closing and for an indefinite period thereafter there will be no public market for the New Topco Units and, accordingly, the Rollover
Stockholder will not be able to transfer the New Topco Units in case of emergency, if at all (except as permitted by the Topco LP Agreement). In addition,
the Rollover Stockholder understands that the Topco LP Agreement will contain restrictions on the transferability of the New Topco Units and will
provide that, in the event that the conditions relating to the transfer of any New Topco Units in such document have not been satisfied, the Rollover
Stockholder will not be able to transfer any such New Topco Units, and unless otherwise specified, Topco LP will not recognize the transfer of any such
New Topco Units on its books and records or issue any certificates representing any such New Topco Units, and any purported transfer not in
accordance with the terms of the Topco LP Agreement shall be
C-3
Table of Contents
void. As such, the Rollover Stockholder understands that: (A) if the New Topco Units are certificated, a restrictive legend or legends will be placed on the
certificates representing the New Topco Units; (B) a notation will be made in the appropriate records of Topco LP indicating that the New Topco Units are
subject to restrictions on transfer and, if Topco LP should at some time in the future engage the services of a securities transfer agent, appropriate stop-
transfer instructions will be issued to such transfer agent with respect to the New Topco Units; and (C) the Rollover Stockholder will sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the New Topco Units only in a manner consistent with its representations and warranties set forth herein and then only in
accordance with the Topco LP Agreement and applicable Laws.

against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no action shall be taken by or on behalf of the Rollover Stockholder
under or with respect to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Special Committee.

Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the
other parties, provided that the Rollover Stockholder may assign its rights hereunder without consent of the other parties in connection with the transfer
of the New Topco Units in compliance with the terms and conditions of Annex B hereto; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve any party hereto
of its obligations set forth in this Agreement to the extent not performed by the successor or permitted assign, as applicable. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Section 6(b) shall be null and void.
(c) Construction. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the
singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; (iii) the terms “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereto” and derivative or
similar words refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iv) the terms “Article” or “Section” refer to the
specified Article or Section of this Agreement; (v) whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation,” and (vi) the word “or” shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. The headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Words denoting natural persons shall be
deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party. All Annexes hereto are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. The word “party” shall,
unless the context otherwise requires, be construed to mean a party to this Agreement. Any reference to a party to this Agreement or any other
agreement or document contemplated hereby shall include such party’s successors and permitted assigns.
(d) Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements and each of the documents, instruments and agreements
delivered in connection with the Transactions, including each of the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitute
the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder.
(f) Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and deliver all such further and additional instruments and agreements and shall take such
further and additional actions, as may be reasonably necessary or desirable and as reasonably requested by any other party hereto to evidence or carry

(g) Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Sections 9.07, 9.08 and 9.09 of theMerger Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by
reference, mutatis mutandis.
(h) Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
(i) Survival. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby indefinitely.

Contribution, together with certain cash contributions made by Topco LP to Topco Inc. in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, shall constitute a single integrated transaction that qualifies under Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) and (ii) the Topco LP Contribution shall be treated as a transaction described under Section 721(a) of the Code. The
parties to this Agreement agree to report such transactions for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes in accordance with, and
will not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with, such intended tax treatment, unless required by applicable law.
(k) Specific Performance. The Rollover Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the breach of this Agreement by it would cause irreparable
damage to Topco LP and Topco Inc. and their respective affiliates and that Topco LP and Topco Inc. will not have an adequate remedy under applicable
Laws, and each of Topco LP and Topco Inc. acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Agreement by Topco LP and Topco Inc. would cause
irreparable damage to the Rollover Stockholder and that the Rollover Stockholder will not have an adequate remedy under applicable Laws. Therefore, the
obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance if issued by the courts specified in
Section 6(g) above, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or
order of specific performance or other equitable remedy shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such
remedy shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.
(l) Irrevocability; Termination. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be permitted to terminate or rescind this Agreement;
provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically terminate if, at any time prior to the Contribution Closing, the Merger Agreement shall have
been validly terminated for any reason by any of the parties thereto in accordance with its terms and conditions. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in this Section 6(l), this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void ab initio and of no further force or effect and there shall
be no liability on the part of any parties hereto or their respective officers or directors. In the event the Closing does not occur immediately following the
Topco Inc. Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo and BidCo Contributions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Topco Inc.
Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo and BidCo Contributions shall be null and void and the parties shall cooperate and take all such actions
as are necessary to unwind the transactions that were consummated in connection with the Topco Inc. Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo
and BidCo Contributions.
(m) Incorporation of Recitals. The Recitals set forth above are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and shall be deemed binding provisions
hereof.

New Topco Units for an indefinite period of time and is able to bear the economic risk and withstand a complete loss of the Rollover Stockholder’s
investment in the New Topco Units.
(e) The New Topco Units to be received by the Rollover Stockholder at the Contribution Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be
acquired by it for investment only for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part thereof in
violation of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities Laws. The Rollover Stockholder has no current intention of selling, granting participation
in or otherwise distributing the New Topco Units in violation of applicable U.S. federal or state or foreign securities Laws.
(f) The Rollover Stockholder understands that the offer and sale of the New Topco Units and Topco Stock, as applicable, have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any applicable U.S. state or foreign securities Laws, and that the New Topco Units and Topco Stock, as applicable, are being
issued in reliance on an exemption from registration, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent
and the accuracy of the Rollover Stockholder’s representations as expressed herein.
(g) The Rollover Stockholder understands that there will be substantial restrictions on the transferability of the New Topco Units and that on the
date of the Closing and for an indefinite period thereafter there will be no public market for the New Topco Units and, accordingly, the Rollover
Stockholder will not be able to transfer the New Topco Units in case of emergency, if at all (except as permitted by the Topco LP Agreement). In addition,
the Rollover Stockholder understands that the Topco LP Agreement will contain restrictions on the transferability of the New Topco Units and will
provide that, in the event that the conditions relating to the transfer of any New Topco Units in such document have not been satisfied, the Rollover
Stockholder will not be able to transfer any such New Topco Units, and unless otherwise specified, Topco LP will not recognize the transfer of any such
New Topco Units on its books and records or issue any certificates representing any such New Topco Units, and any purported transfer not in
accordance with the terms of the Topco LP Agreement shall be void. As such, the Rollover Stockholder understands that: (A) if the New Topco Units are
certificated, a restrictive legend or legends will be placed on the certificates representing the New Topco Units; (B) a notation will be made in the
appropriate
C-13
Table of Contents
records of Topco LP indicating that the New Topco Units are subject to restrictions on transfer and, if Topco LP should at some time in the future engage
the services of a securities transfer agent, appropriate stop-transfer instructions will be issued to such transfer agent with respect to the New Topco
Units; and (C) the Rollover Stockholder will sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the New Topco Units only in a manner consistent with its
representations and warranties set forth herein and then only in accordance with the Topco LP Agreement and applicable Laws.

against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the
other parties, provided that the Rollover Stockholder may assign its rights hereunder without consent of the other parties in connection with the transfer
of the New Topco Units in compliance with the terms and conditions of Annex B hereto; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve any party hereto
of its obligations set forth in this Agreement to the extent not performed by the successor or permitted assign, as applicable. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Section 6(b) shall be null and void.
(c) Construction. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the
singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; (iii) the terms “hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereto” and derivative or
similar words refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iv) the terms “Article” or “Section” refer to the
specified Article or Section of this Agreement; (v) whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation,” and (vi) the word “or” shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. The headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Words denoting natural persons shall be
deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The language used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party. All Annexes hereto are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. The word “party” shall,
unless the context otherwise requires, be construed to mean a party to this Agreement. Any reference to a party to this Agreement or any other
agreement or document contemplated hereby shall include such party’s successors and permitted assigns.
(d) Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF

(g) Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Sections 9.07, 9.08 and 9.09 of theMerger Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by
reference, mutatis mutandis.
(h) Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
(i) Survival. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby indefinitely.
(j) Tax Treatment. The parties to this Agreement intend that for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, (i) the Topco Inc.
Contribution, together with certain cash contributions made by Topco LP to Topco Inc. in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, shall constitute a single integrated transaction that qualifies under Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) and (ii) the Topco LP Contribution shall be treated as a transaction described under Section 721(a) of the Code. The
parties to this Agreement agree to report such transactions for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes in accordance with, and
will not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with, such intended tax treatment, unless required by applicable law.

damage to Topco LP and Topco Inc. and their respective affiliates and that Topco LP and Topco Inc. will not have an adequate remedy under applicable
Laws, and each of Topco LP and Topco Inc. acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Agreement by Topco LP and Topco Inc. would cause
irreparable damage to the Rollover Stockholder and that the Rollover Stockholder will not have an adequate remedy under applicable Laws. Therefore, the
obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance if issued by the courts specified in
Section 6(g) above, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or
order of specific performance or other equitable remedy shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such
remedy shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.
(l) Irrevocability; Termination. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be permitted to terminate or rescind this Agreement;
provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically terminate if, at any time prior to the Contribution Closing, the Merger Agreement shall have
been validly terminated for any reason by any of the parties thereto in accordance with its terms and conditions. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in this Section 6(l), this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void ab initio and of no further force or effect and there shall
be no liability on the part of any parties hereto or their respective officers or directors. In the event the Closing does not occur immediately following the
Topco Inc. Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo and BidCo Contributions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Topco Inc.
Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo and BidCo Contributions shall be null and void and the parties shall cooperate and take all such actions
as are necessary to unwind the transactions that were consummated in connection with the Topco Inc. Contribution, Topco LP Contribution or MidCo

The Board of Directors
Inovalon Holdings, Inc.
4321 Collington Road
Bowie, Maryland 20716
Members of the Board of Directors:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Public Stockholders (as defined in the Agreement) of Class A
common stock, par value $0.000005 per share (the “Company Class A Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, par value $0.000005 per share (the
“Company Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Company Class A Common Stock, the “Company Common Stock”), of Inovalon Holdings, Inc.
(the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the “Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ocala Bidco, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 19, 2021 (the “Agreement”), among
the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Acquiror and its affiliates
and Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares (each as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $41.00 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”).
In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available
financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the
financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and
reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Class A Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
(v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management of the Company relating to its business;
and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion.
In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and the Acquiror with respect to certain aspects of the
Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company,
and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.
In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to
or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of
the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to
which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have
also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will have the tax consequences described in discussions
with, and materials furnished to us by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Agreement and pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and
the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on
the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or
other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction.
Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that
Table of Contents
we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid
in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the
underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be
paid to the Public Stockholders in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a
substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us
for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. Please be advised that during the two years preceding the date of this letter, neither we nor our
affiliates have had any other material financial advisory or other material commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, the Acquiror,
Meritas Group, Inc., which holds approximately 30% of the capital stock of the Company, GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture Partners, L.P. or 22C Capital LLC.
During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had, and continue to have, commercial or investment banking
relationships with certain affiliates of the Acquiror as well as certain affiliates of each of GIC Pte. Ltd., Insight Venture Partners, L.P. and 22C Capital LLC,
for which we and such affiliates have received, or will receive, customary compensation. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent
bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of certain affiliates of GIC Pte. Ltd. and certain affiliates of Insight Venture Partners, L.P., for which it
receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the
outstanding common stock of the Company. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.
On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid to the Public Stockholders in the
proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Board of
Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not
constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other
matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with
our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or information statement mailed to shareholders of the Company but may
not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written approval.
Very truly yours,
/s/ J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

Special Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”)
Inovalon Holdings, Inc.
4321 Collington Road
Bowie, Maryland, 20716
Members of the Special Committee:
We understand that Inovalon Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”),
with Ocala Bidco, Inc. (the “Acquiror”), an affiliate of Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL (“Nordic”), GIC Private Limited (“GIC”) and Insight Partners, LLC
(“Insight”), and Ocala Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror ( “Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Merger”). As a
result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock, $0.000005 par value per share (the “Company Class A Common Stock”), and Class
B common stock, $0.000005 par value per share (the “Company Class B Common Stock”), of the Company (such Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock, together, the “Company Common Stock”), other than shares of the Company Common Stock owned by the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any
of their subsidiaries, shares of the Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock, Rollover Shares (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $41.00 per share in cash (the “Merger
Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Special Committee has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by Public Stockholders (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
(i)
reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant, including
publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
(ii)
reviewed certain internal projected financial data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company,
as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”);
(iii)
discussed with management of the Company their assessment of the past and current operations of the Company, the current financial
condition and prospects of the Company, and the Forecasts (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving the
Forecasts);
(iv)
reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of shares of the Company Common Stock;
(v)
compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded
companies that we deemed relevant;
(vi)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with the financial terms, to the
extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant;
(vii)
reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated August 18, 2021, of the Merger Agreement; and
(viii)
performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, without any independent
verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information), and have further
relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Forecasts, we have assumed with your consent that they have been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the
Company and the other matters covered thereby. We express no view as to the Forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based.

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the final executed Merger Agreement will
not differ from the draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are
true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all
conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed, in all respects material
to our analysis, that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation of the Merger or reduce the
contemplated benefits to the Public Stockholders of the Merger.
We have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company and have not made or assumed any responsibility for
making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the
Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made
available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is
understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.
We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the Public Stockholders, from a
financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed
transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. We have not been asked to, nor do we express
any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, including, without limitation, the
structure or form of the Merger, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or
amended in connection with the Merger Agreement. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or
financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the
Merger. We were not requested to, and we did not, participate in the negotiation of the terms of the Merger, nor were we requested to, and we did not,
provide any advice or services in connection with the Merger other than the delivery of this opinion. We express no view or opinion as to any such
matters. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to
how any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices
at which shares of the Company Common Stock will trade at any time, as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on
the Company or the Merger or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its
obligations when they come due. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of
assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.
We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with the Merger and have received and will receive a fee for our
services, a portion of which was payable upon the execution of the engagement letter among the Special Committee, the Company and us, a portion of
which is payable upon rendering this opinion, and a portion of which is payable in the sole discretion of the Special Committee and a portion of which is
payable if the Special Committee and we mutually agree to expand the scope of our services. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses
and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C.
and its affiliates have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and we have not received any compensation from
the Company during such period. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial
advisory services to Nordic and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the rendering of these services. During the two year period prior to the date
hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory services to GIC and certain of its affiliates and received fees for the
rendering of these services. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services to Insight and certain of its affiliates and received fees for

the rendering of these services. We may provide financial advisory or other services to the Company and the Acquiror and their respective affiliates,
including Nordic, GIC, Insight and their respective affiliates, in the future, and in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for our and their own accounts and the accounts of customers,
including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity sales, trading and research, private equity, placement agent, asset management and related
activities. In connection with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and/or our or their respective employees, as well as
investment funds in which any of them may have a financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or
otherwise effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products or
other financial instruments of or relating to the Company, the Acquiror, potential parties to the Merger and/or any of their respective affiliates, including
Nordic, GIC, Insight and their respective affiliates, or persons that are competitors, customers or suppliers of the Company, the Acquiror or their
respective affiliates, including Nordic, GIC, Insight and their respective affiliates.
Our financial advisory services and this opinion are provided for the information and benefit of the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed Transaction. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group
L.L.C.
This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except
with our prior written approval, except the Company may reproduce this opinion in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and required to be mailed by the Company to its stockholders relating to the Merger.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the Public
Stockholders in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Very truly yours,
EVERCORE GROUP L.L.C.

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
§262 Appraisal rights
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to §228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation, the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt
or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in one (1) or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which
stock is deposited with the depository.
(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to §§251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to §251(g) of this title), 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 or 264 of this title:
(1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock,
or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to §251(h), as of immediately prior to the
execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger
did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §251(f) of this title.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251,
252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:
a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this
section; or
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §253 or §267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.
(4) [Repealed.]
(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.
(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty (20) days prior to the meeting,
F-1
Table of Contents
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if one (1) of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written
demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if
directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within ten (10) days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has
not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or
(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253 or §267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within ten (10) days thereafter shall notify each of
the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if one (1) of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title.
Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within twenty (20) days after the date of giving such notice or, in
the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this
title and twenty (20) days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such
holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing
system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second
notice to all such holders on or within ten (10) days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than
twenty (20) days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the later of
the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and twenty (20) days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to
give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more
than ten (10) days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record
date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving

the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
(or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in
§251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in §251(h)
(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
statement shall be given to the stockholder within ten (10) days after such stockholder’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within ten (10) days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section
hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.
(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall, within twenty (20) days after such service, file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares
have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall
be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by one (1) or more publications at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and
by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.
(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or
consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal; (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000; or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§253 or §267 of this title.
(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair
value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to
the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter
with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.
(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
